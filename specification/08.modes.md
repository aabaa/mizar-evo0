## 8.1 Definition and Purpose of Modes

Modes are user-defined type constructors built on top of radix-types such as `set` or `struct`. They allow:

* **Abstraction** of mathematical concepts as types
* **Refinement** of types using attributes
* **Composition** of complex types
* **Dependency** on values (i.e., dependent types)

Modes are a central mechanism for type classification in Mizar Evolution, offering an abstract and modular alternative to structures.

## 8.2 Syntax for Declaring and Using Modes

### Mode Definition

```mizar
definition
  mode Label: <mode_name> is <attribute_chain> <type_expression>;
end;
```

Here, `<attribute_chain>` is a (possibly empty) sequence of unary predicates that refine the base type. Attributes must be defined using the `attr` keyword (see Chapter 7).

Examples:

```mizar
definition
  mode IntegerDef: Integer is integer Number;
  mode PrimeDef: Prime is prime Integer;
  mode GroupDef: Group is non empty associative invertible unital Magma;
end;
```

### Mode Application

Modes are used in variable declarations, expressions, and type restrictions:

```mizar
let G be Group;
let n be Prime;
```

## 8.3 Type Inference with Modes

Mizar automatically infers type relations for variables declared with modes:

* Inference follows attribute clusters and structural inheritance
* Inference supports dependent modes and parameterized types

Examples:

```mizar
let n be Prime;  :: implies n is Integer and Number
let S be Subset of X;  :: implies S is set and S ⊆ X
```

## 8.4 Mode Implementation

Internally, each mode is interpreted as:

1. A unary predicate for membership
2. A cluster registration linking attributes and base types

This supports a uniform and efficient type checking mechanism.

```mizar
definition
  mode M is <attribute_chain> <type_expression>;
end;
```

is equivalent to defining a predicate and a cluster registration.

## 8.5 Relationship between Modes and Structures

Modes and structures serve complementary roles. Use **structures** when you need to define composite types with internal fields (e.g., algebraic structures like rings or groups). Use **modes** when you want to classify or restrict existing types by logical properties without adding internal structure (e.g., prime numbers, continuous functions).

| Aspect     | Modes                                | Structures                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Definition | Abstract (via attributes)            | Concrete (via fields/properties)   |
| Usage      | Conceptual classification            | Data modeling and component access |
| Conversion | `qua` operator for structural access | Field/method access is explicit    |

Example:

```mizar
definition
  struct MetricStruct where
    field carrier -> set;
    field distance -> Function of [:carrier, carrier:], REAL;
  end;

definition
  mode MetricSpaceDef: MetricSpace is reflective discerning symmetric triangle MetricStruct;
end;
```

## 8.6 Unified Mode Syntax

Mizar Evolution enforces the `is` syntax for mode definitions, replacing the legacy `means` form. This ensures:

* Simplified parsing and inference
* Uniform representation across the language
* Clear separation between types (modes) and predicates (logical properties)

Instead of:

```mizar
definition
  mode PrimeLegacy: Prime means <predicate>;
end;
```

Use:

```mizar
definition
  let n be Nat;
  attr PrimeAttr: n is prime means <definition>;

  mode PrimeDef: Prime is prime Integer;
end;
```

## 8.7 Dependent Modes

Modes can be parameterized using `of` or `over`:

```mizar
definition
  mode SubsetDef: Subset of X is X-subset_like set;
  mode MatrixDef: Matrix over R is R-matrix_like set;
end;

let A be Matrix over REAL;
```

These forms are syntactic sugar for template-style definitions. For example, `Matrix over REAL` is equivalent to `Matrix[REAL]` in other notations.

Multiple parameters are supported:

```mizar
definition
  mode FinDimVSDef: FinDimVectorSpace over F, n is n-dimensional vector_space_like structure over F;
end;

let V be FinDimVectorSpace over COMPLEX, 5;
```

## 8.8 Correctness Conditions

Mode definitions require existence guarantees, typically provided by cluster registrations:

```mizar
registration
  cluster prime Integer;
  existence
  proof
    take 2; thus 2 is prime;
  end;
end;

definition
  mode PrimeDef2: Prime is prime Integer;
end;
```

To avoid warnings, ensure all mode base types with attribute chains have existential registrations.

Note: In Mizar Evolution, existence checks for modes follow a two-stage policy. At the point of mode declaration (using the mode keyword), the system issues a warning if no existential registration is found. If such a mode is subsequently used (e.g., in variable declarations), and the required existence proof is still missing, a hard error is raised. This encourages early validation while supporting modular development.
