## 4.1. Variables in First-Order Logic and Mizar

### 4.1.1. First-Order Logic Variables

In standard first-order logic, variables are untyped symbols that range over the domain of discourse.

Example in FOL: `∀x(P(x) → ∃y(R(x,y)))`

### 4.1.2. Mizar's Typed Variable System

Mizar extends first-order logic by associating variables with types. In Mizar's system, a type represents a collection of objects characterized by a predicate.

### 4.1.3. Correspondence between FOL and Mizar Variables

Mizar's typed variables correspond to FOL variables with additional predicate constraints:

**Mizar:**
```mizar
let x be Real;
```

**FOL equivalent:**
```
Real(x) ∧ ...
```

The type `Real` becomes a predicate `Real(x)` in the underlying first-order logic.

## 4.2. Variable Declarations

### 4.2.1. Basic Variable Declaration Syntax

Mizar uses the `let` keyword for variable declarations:

```mizar
let <identifier> be <type>;
```

Examples:
```mizar
let x be Real;
let n be Nat;
let G be Group;
```

### 4.2.2. Type Specifications and Constraints

Variables can be declared with type expressions that include additional constraints (=attributes):

```mizar
let n be positive Nat;
let G be finite Group;
let S be non empty set;
```

Multiple constraints can be applied:
```mizar
let n be positive even Nat;
```

### 4.2.3. Multiple Variable Declarations

Multiple variables of the same type can be declared simultaneously:

```mizar
let x, y, z be Real;
let m, n be Nat;
let G, H be Group;
```

## 4.3. Constants

### 4.3.1. Numerals

Numerals are the only built-in constants in Mizar, representing natural numbers:

```mizar
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
```

**Properties of numerals:**
- Type: `natural Number` (inferred automatically)
- Syntax: Sequence of digits starting with non-zero digit (except for 0)
- Usage: Direct mathematical operations and comparisons

**Examples:**
```mizar
let n be Nat;
assume n = 5;
thus n > 0;
```

### 4.3.2. Set Declarations

The `set` keyword declares named constants that represent specific objects:

```mizar
set <identifier> = <expression>;
```

**Basic set declarations:**
```mizar
set X = {1, 2, 3};
set f = id REAL;
set n = 2 + 3;
```

**Set declarations with type specification:**
```mizar
set X = {1, 2, 3};
reconsider X as finite set;
```

**Relationship to FOL:**
Set declarations introduce new constant symbols in the underlying FOL with defining equations:
```mizar
set c = expr;
```
corresponds to FOL: `c = expr`

## 4.4. Variable Scoping Rules

### 4.4.1. Local Scope in Theorems and Definitions

**Theorem statements** contain only bound variables (no `let` declarations):
```mizar
theorem
  for x being Real holds x^2 >= 0;  :: x is bound by 'for'
```

**Proof blocks** can contain instantiated variable declarations:
```mizar
theorem
  for x being Real holds x^2 >= 0
proof
  let x be Real;     :: Instantiated variable declaration in proof
  ...
end;
```

**Definition blocks** use `let` for parameter declarations:
```mizar
definition
  let X be set;      :: Parameter declaration
  let f be Function of X, X;
  ...
end
```

### 4.4.2. Nested Scopes and Variable Shadowing

Inner proof blocks can declare variables that shadow variables from outer proof blocks:

```mizar
theorem
  for X being set holds X \/ {} = X
proof
  let X be set;
  let x be object;
  assume x in X;
  thus X c= X \/ {};
  
  hence X \/ {} c= X
  proof
    let x be object; :: Different x from the one in outer proof
    assume x in X \/ {};
    then x in X or x in {};
    hence thesis;
  end;
end;
```

**Shadowing rules:**
- Inner proof blocks can declare variables with the same name as outer blocks
- The most recently declared variable takes precedence within its scope
- Shadowing is lexically scoped within proof block hierarchies

### 4.4.3. Module-level Scoping

**Reserve declarations** specify default types for identifiers:

```mizar
reserve x for Real;
reserve n for Nat;
```

Reserve declarations:
- Associate identifiers with types for the entire module
- Allow omitting explicit type declarations in some contexts
- Can be overridden by explicit local declarations

```mizar
reserve x for Real;

theorem
  for x being Nat holds x >= 0    :: x is bound as Nat (overrides reserve)
proof
  let x be Nat;                   :: Consistent with quantifier binding
  thus x >= 0;
end;
```

### 4.4.4. Bound Variables in Quantified Expressions

Variables in quantified expressions follow standard binding rules:

```mizar
for x being Real holds P(x)           :: x is bound by 'for'
ex n being Nat st Q(n)                :: n is bound by 'ex'
{ x where x is Element of S : P(x) }  :: x is bound by set comprehension
```

**Binding scopes:**
- Quantifier scope extends to the end of the quantified formula
- Each quantifier introduces a new binding scope

**Example with nested quantifiers:**
```mizar
theorem
  for x being Real ex y being Real st
    for z being Real holds R(x, y, z);
```

In this example:
- `x` is bound by the outer `for`
- `y` is bound by `ex`  
- `z` is bound by the inner `for`

### 4.4.5. Variable vs Symbol Precedence

**Identifier precedence over symbols:**
Variable identifiers take precedence over imported symbols with the same name:

```mizar
import module_with_symbol_id;    :: Module exports symbol 'id'
reserve id for Real;

theorem
  for id being Nat holds id >= 0  :: 'id' refers to variable, not imported symbol
proof
  let id be Nat;                 :: Variable declaration shadows imported symbol
  :: To access imported symbol: module_with_symbol_id.id
end;
```

### 4.4.6. Error Conditions in Variable Scoping

**Same-scope redeclaration errors:**
Redeclaring variables with different types in the same scope produces an error:

```mizar
proof
  let x be Real;
  let x be Nat;      :: Error: redeclaration with different type in same scope
end;
```

**Type mismatch in nested scopes:**
While shadowing is allowed, type consistency must be maintained where required:

```mizar
theorem
  for x being Real holds x > 0
proof
  let x be Real;     :: Consistent with quantifier
  assume x > 0;
  
  hence thesis
  proof
    let x be Nat;    :: Valid shadowing in inner scope
    :: Different x from outer scope
  end;
end;
```
