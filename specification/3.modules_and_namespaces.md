# 3. Modules and Namespaces

## 3.1 Module Structure

In the redesigned Mizar system, modules play a crucial role in organizing and structuring mathematical knowledge. A module in Mizar represents a cohesive unit of mathematical content, typically focusing on a specific concept, theory, or related group of definitions and theorems.

### Definition and Purpose

A Mizar module is a self-contained unit of formalized mathematics that:
    - Encapsulates related mathematical concepts, definitions, and theorems
    - Provides a mechanism for organizing and structuring large mathematical formalizations
    - Facilitates code reuse and maintenance
    - Enables collaborative development of mathematical libraries

### One-to-One Correspondence with Files

In the new Mizar design, there is a direct one-to-one correspondence between modules and `.miz` files:
    1. Each `.miz` file represents exactly one module.
    2. The module name typically matches the file name (without the .miz extension).
    3. The file's location in the directory structure determines its namespace.
    4. For example, a file located at `/math/algebra/group.miz` defines the `group` module in the `math.algebra` namespace.

### Basic Components of a Module

A typical Mizar module consists of the following components:
    1. **Module Header**: Contains metadata about the module, including its name and any necessary import statements.
    2. **Definitions**: Introduce new mathematical objects, functions, or predicates.
    3. **Theorems**: State and prove mathematical propositions.
    4. **Schemes**: Define general reasoning patterns.
    5. **Registrations**: Provide type information and properties of defined objects.
    6. **Notations**: Introduce new notational conventions or syntax.
