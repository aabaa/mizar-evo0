# 3. Modules and Namespaces

## 3.1 Module Structure and Namespace Rules

In the redesigned Mizar system, modules play a crucial role in organizing and structuring mathematical knowledge. A module in Mizar represents a cohesive unit of mathematical content, typically focusing on a specific concept, theory, or related group of definitions and theorems.

### Definition and Purpose

A Mizar module is a self-contained unit of formalized mathematics that:
    - Encapsulates related mathematical concepts, definitions, and theorems
    - Provides a mechanism for organizing and structuring large mathematical formalizations
    - Facilitates code reuse and maintenance
    - Enables collaborative development of mathematical libraries

### One-to-One Correspondence with Directories and Files

In the new Mizar design, there is a direct one-to-one correspondence between modules and `.miz` files:
    1. Each `.miz` file represents exactly one module.
    2. The module name typically matches the file name (without the .miz extension).
    3. The file's location in the directory structure determines its namespace.
    4. For example, a file located at `/mml/algebra/group.miz` defines the `group` module in the `mml.algebra` namespace.

### Namespace Derivation and Hierarchy

1. **Root Namespace**: The root directory of the Mizar library corresponds to the global namespace.
2. **Subdirectories**: Each subdirectory adds a level to the namespace hierarchy.
3. **Dot Notation**: Namespaces use dot notation to represent hierarchy levels (e.g., `mml.algebra.group`).

### Repository Structure and Namespaces

The Mizar system is organized into three main repositories, each with its own namespace:

1. **Mizar Mathematical Library (MML)**: `/mml`
   - This is the main repository for formalized mathematics.
   - Namespaces in MML follow the directory structure, e.g., `/mml/algebra/group/group.miz` corresponds to the `mml.algebra.group` namespace and the `group` module.

2. **Formalized Mathematics (FM)**: `/fm`
   - This repository is used for publishing articles in the journal "Formalized Mathematics".
   - Articles are organized by year, e.g., `/fm/y2024/ndiff12.miz` corresponds to the `fm.y2024` namespace and the `ndiff12` module.

3. **User Repository**: `/user`
   - This space is allocated for individual users to develop and store their own formalizations.
   - User namespaces are prefixed with their GitHub username, e.g., `/user/@aabaa/myproject/abc.miz` corresponds to the `user.@aabaa.myproject` namespace and the `abc` module.

### Naming Conventions

1. **Valid Characters**: Module and namespace names should consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive names that reflect the mathematical concepts contained within.
3. **Avoiding Conflicts**: Ensure that module and namespace names do not conflict with reserved keywords or built-in Mizar constructs.
