# 5. Type System

## 5.1. Introduction to Mizar's Type System

### 5.1.1. Overview of Mizar's Type System

Mizar's type system is a key feature that forms the backbone of its formal mathematical language. Unlike many other type theory-based proof assistants, Mizar's types are not part of the logical foundation of the system. Instead, Mizar is based on untyped set theory, and its type system can be understood as a layer of "soft typing" built on top of this foundation.

Key characteristics of Mizar's type system include:

1. **Soft Types**: Mizar's types are essentially syntactic constructs. They guide the writing and checking of mathematical statements but do not intrude into the underlying logical foundation of the system.

2. **Set-Theoretic Foundation**: All Mizar expressions are ultimately about sets. The types in Mizar can be thought of as predicates that classify these sets.

3. **Type Checking as Proof Obligation Generation**: When Mizar performs type checking, it generates proof obligations in first-order logic. These obligations, if proven, ensure the type correctness of the mathematical statements.

### 5.1.2. Key Concepts

Several key concepts form the foundation of Mizar's type system:

1. **Radix-types**: These are the basic types in Mizar, such as `set` (the root type) or user-defined types like modes and structures.

2. **Attributes**: These are type modifiers that can be applied to -types. For example, `positive` and `negative` could be attributes applied to the `integer` type.

3. **Modes**: These are type constructors that define new types based on existing ones. They allow for more abstract type definitions and can be dependent.

4. **Structures**: These are composite types that group related data and properties, similar to record types in other systems.

5. **Clusters**: These are mechanisms for declaring relationships between types and attributes, such as subset relationships or attribute implications.

### 5.1.3. Relation to First-Order Logic

The relationship between Mizar's type system and first-order logic is central to its design:

1. **Types as Predicates**: Each type in Mizar corresponds to a predicate in first-order logic. For example, a type `T` is equivalent to a predicate `is_T(x)` in the underlying logic.

2. **Subtyping as Implication**: When one type is a subtype of another in Mizar, this relationship is represented as an implication in first-order logic. For instance, if `S` is a subtype of `T`, this is equivalent to the formula `∀x(is_S(x) ⇒ is_T(x))`.

3. **Type Erasure**: All type information in Mizar can be erased, resulting in untyped first-order logic formulas. This erasure process demonstrates that types in Mizar are not foundational to its logical system.

### 5.1.4. Design Philosophy

The design of Mizar's type system is guided by several key principles:

1. **Mathematical Intuitiveness**: The type system aims to closely align with mathematical thinking, allowing mathematicians to express concepts in a familiar way.

2. **Formal Rigor**: While intuitive, the system maintains strict formal semantics, ensuring that all expressions are unambiguous and logically sound.

3. **Expressiveness**: The type system is designed to handle a wide range of mathematical structures, from simple number systems to complex algebraic structures.

4. **Efficiency**: The type system is designed to allow for efficient type checking and inference, balancing expressiveness with practical implementation concerns.

5. **Set-Theoretic Foundation**: The type system is built on top of set theory, which allows for a clear separation between the type system and the underlying logical foundation.

By adhering to these principles, Mizar's type system provides a powerful tool for formalizing mathematics, striking a balance between intuitive expression and formal precision, while maintaining a clear connection to classical first-order logic and set theory.

## 5.2. Basic Types and Type Declarations

### 5.2.1. Built-in Types

Mizar's type system is built upon a foundation of basic types. In recent versions of the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML), the basic type hierarchy now includes:

1. **object**: The root type, representing all objects in the Mizar universe.
2. **set**: A subtype of `object`, representing mathematical sets.

The introduction of `object` as the root type allows for a distinction between primitive sets and other objects in the Mizar universe. `object` includes structural types defined by using `struct` keyword.

### 5.2.2. Syntax for Type Declarations

In Mizar, type declarations are made using specific keywords and constructs. Here are the main ways to declare and use types:

1. **Structure Definitions**

    Structures are used to define complex types with multiple fields:

    ```mizar
    definition
      struct Point2d where
        field x -> Real;
        field y -> Real;
      end
    end
    ```

2. **Attribute Definitions**

    Attributes are used to refine types:

    ```mizar
    definition
      let i be Integer;
      attr i is even means
      2 divides i;
    end
    ```

3. **Mode Definitions**

    Modes are used to introduce new types:

    ```mizar
    definition
      mode Integer is integer Number;
    end
    ```

    Modes and structures are collectively referred to as radix-types. These form the foundation for defining new types in the system.

4. **Type Expressions**

    Types can be combined and refined using various constructs:

    - Attribute application: `A T` (e.g., `positive Integer`)
    - Dependent types: `M of T` (where `M` is a mode that depends on `T`)

5. **Variable Declarations**

    Variables are declared with their types:

    ```mizar
    let n be positive Integer;
    let I be set;
    let f be Group-Family of I;
    ```

## 5.3. Structures

### 5.3.1. Concept and Purpose of Structures

Structures in Mizar are fundamental constructs used to define complex types that group related fields and properties. They serve several key purposes:

1. **Data Encapsulation**: Structures allow related pieces of data to be grouped together, similar to record types in other programming languages.
2. **Type Definition**: They form the basis for defining new types in the Mizar system, along with modes.
3. **Mathematical Modeling**: Structures provide a way to formally represent mathematical concepts that have multiple components or properties.

Structures are considered radix-types, meaning they form the foundation for defining new types in the system.

### 5.3.2. Syntax for Defining Structures

The syntax for defining structures in Mizar has been updated to provide more flexibility. The new syntax is as follows:

```mizar
definition
  struct StructureName where
    field field1 -> Type1;
    field field2 -> Type2;
    ...
    property property1 -> Type1';
    property property2 -> Type2';
    ...
  end
end
```

Key components of this syntax:

- `struct` keyword introduces a structure definition
- `StructureName` is the name of the new structure
- `field` declarations define the data components of the structure
- `property` declarations define properties associated with the structure

The distinction between `field` and `property` lies in their roles: fields represent intrinsic data, while properties represent derived data. For instance, in a group structure, the carrier set and binary operation are fields, while the identity element is a property as it is derived from the properties of the carrier and operation. Typically, property values are computed using functors that take field values as arguments.

Example:

```mizar
definition
  ::=
  `UnitalMagma` is a magma with an identity element.
  `UnitalMagma` consists of a set `carrier` with a single binary operator `binop`.
  Additionally, `UnitalMagma` has an identity element `unit` that is derived from
  the properties of `carrier` and `binop`.
  =::
  struct UnitalMagma where
    field carrier -> set;
    field binop -> BinOp of the carrier;
    property unit -> Element of carrier;
  end
end
```

### 5.3.3. Inheritance Mechanisms

Mizar supports inheritance for structures, allowing a structure to inherit from existing ones. The syntax for inheritance is:

```mizar
definition
  inherit DerivedStructure from BaseStructure where
    field derivedField1 from baseField1;
    field derivedField2 from baseField2;
    ...
    property derivedProperty1 from baseProperty1;
    property derivedProperty2 from baseProperty2;
    ...
  end
end
```

Inheritance enables the reuse of predicates, functors, and attributes from the base structure through implicit type conversion (in the up-cast direction). A derived structure must inherit all fields and properties from its base structure; omitting any field or property will result in a compilation error. Furthermore, fields must be inherited as fields, and properties must be inherited as properties.

The new syntax separates structure declaration from inheritance declaration, allowing base structures to be added after the initial structure declaration. This separation, combined with field and property renaming, enables more flexible inheritance patterns.

Structures can also inherit from set types:

```mizar
inherit 1-sorted from set where
  field carrier from it;
end
```

Here, `it` refers to the set itself. This inheritance allows all predicates, functors, and attributes applicable to the set to be implicitly applied to the 1-sorted structure.

Inheritance supports type specialization of fields and properties:

```mizar
definition
  inherit T from S where
    ...
  end

  struct A where
    field x -> X;
  end

  struct B where
    field y -> Y;
  end

  inherit B from A where
    field y inherit x;
    consistency;
  end
end
```

Type consistency must be proven, requiring a proof that `for x being X holds x is Y`.

### 5.3.4. Multiple Inheritance and Diamond Inheritance

Mizar supports multiple inheritance, allowing structures to inherit from multiple base structures:

```mizar
definition
  inherit DerivedStructure from BaseStructure1 where
    ...
  end

  inherit DerivedStructure from BaseStructure2 where
    ...
  end
end
```

To prevent ambiguity, inheriting from the same named structure multiple times is prohibited. When multiple inheritance from the same structure is required, the structure must first be inherited and renamed. Diamond inheritance occurs when a structure inherits from two structures sharing a common ancestor:

```mizar
definition
  struct UnitStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property unit -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  struct ZeroStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property zero -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  inherit ZeroStr from UnitStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property zero from unit;
  end

  struct OneStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property one -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  inherit OneStr from UnitStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property one from unit;
  end

  struct ZeroOneStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property zero -> Element of the carrier;
    property one -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  inherit ZeroOneStr from ZeroStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property zero from zero;
  end

  inherit ZeroOneStr from OneStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property one from one;
  end
end
```

In this example, `UnitStr` is renamed through inheritance to `ZeroStr` and `OneStr`, which are then inherited by `ZeroOneStr`. The common field `carrier` from `UnitStr` is merged in `ZeroOneStr`. Users must ensure the consistency of fields and properties in diamond inheritance scenarios.

### 5.3.5. Constructor

Structures can be instantiated using constructors, which provide mechanisms for object creation and type conversion. Mizar provides both default and custom constructors.

#### Default Constructors

Each structure definition implicitly creates a default constructor that supports two forms of argument passing:

1. **Positional Arguments**:
    Arguments are passed in the order of field and property declarations:

    ```mizar
    let A be set;
    let b be Element of A;
    set x = OneStr(A,b);  :: carrier=A, one=b
    ```

2. **Keyword Arguments**:
    Arguments can be passed in any order by explicitly naming the fields and properties:

    ```mizar
    set y = OneStr(one=b, carrier=A);
    ```

#### Custom Constructors

Constructors can be explicitly declared using the `constructor` keyword:

```mizar
definition
  let G be Group;
  constructor OneStr(G) where
    it.carrier = G.carrier;
    it.one = G.unit;
  end
end
```

The special identifier `it` refers to the structure being constructed, allowing field and property initialization.

#### Converting Constructors

A constructor that takes a single argument serves as a converting constructor, enabling implicit type conversion:

```mizar
let G be Group;
reconsider x = G as OneStr;  :: Implicit conversion from Group to OneStr
```

Converting constructors are particularly useful when working with inheritance hierarchies, allowing automatic conversion from base structures to their derived structures.

## 5.4. Attributes

### 5.4.1. Definition and Purpose of Attributes

Attributes are type modifiers that refine existing types by adding additional properties. They serve several key purposes in Mizar's type system:

1. **Type Refinement**: Attributes allow for the creation of subtypes by adding constraints to existing types.
2. **Property Expression**: They provide a way to express mathematical properties that objects of a given type may possess.
3. **Type Inference**: Through the clustering mechanism, attributes play a role in the type inference system.

### 5.4.2. Syntax for Declaring Attributes

The basic syntax for defining an attribute is:

```mizar
definition
  let T be Type;
  attr T is attribute_name means
    ... definition ...;
end
```

Key components of this syntax:

- `attr` keyword introduces an attribute definition
- `attribute_name` is the name of the new attribute
- `means` clause provides the defining property

Example from algebraic structures:

```mizar
definition
  let M be Magma;
  
  attr M is associative means
    for x, y, z be Element of M holds
    M.binop(M.binop(x,y),z) = M.binop(x,M.binop(y,z));

  attr M is unital means
    ex e be Element of M st
    for x be Element of M holds
    M.binop(x,e) = x & M.binop(e,x) = x;

  attr M is commutative means
    for x, y be Element of M holds
    M.binop(x,y) = M.binop(y,x);
end
```

Attributes can be defined for any type, including built-in types, structures, and modes:

```mizar
definition
  let X be set;
  attr X is empty means
    not ex x be object st x in X;
    
  attr X is finite means
    ex n be Nat st ex f be Function st
    dom f = Seg n & rng f = X & f is one-to-one;
end

definition
  let n be Integer;
  attr n is even means
    ex k be Integer st n = 2*k;
    
  attr n is odd means
    ex k be Integer st n = 2*k + 1;
end
```

### 5.4.3. Using Attributes

Attributes can be used in several ways:

1. **Type Qualification**:
  ```mizar
  let G be associative unital Magma;
  let n be positive even Integer;
  let X be non empty finite set;
  ```

2. **Type Testing**:
  ```mizar
  assume M is commutative;
  if n is odd then ... else ...;
  ```

3. **Attribute Negation**:
  ```mizar
  let M be non empty Magma;
  let n be non zero Integer;
  ```

4. **Attribute in Theorems**:
  ```mizar
  theorem
    for n being Integer st n is even or n is odd
    holds n is even iff not n is odd;
  ```

5. **Complex Conditions**:
  While Mizar doesn't directly support "OR" conditions in attribute qualifications, these can be expressed through theorem statements and logical conditions:
  ```mizar
  theorem
    for n be Integer
    st n is even or n is odd
    holds n * n is odd iff n is odd;
  ```

### 5.4.4. Clustering Mechanism

The clustering mechanism enables automatic attribute inference. There are three types of clusters:

1. **Existential Clusters**:
  Declare that there exist objects with certain attributes:
  ```mizar
  registration
    cluster empty finite set;
    existence
    proof
      ... proof of the existence of empty finite set ...
    end
  end
  ```

2. **Conditional Clusters**:
  Define implications between attributes:
  ```mizar
  registration
    cluster empty -> finite set;
    coherence
    proof
      ... proof that empty set is finite ...
    end
  end
  ```

3. **Functorial Clusters**:
  Specify attributes of terms constructed by functors:
  ```mizar
  registration
    let X be non empty set;
    let Y be set;
    cluster X \/ Y -> non empty;
    coherence
    proof
      ... proof that X \/ Y is non empty ...
    end
  end
  ```

The clustering mechanism is discussed in more detail in [Chapter 10](./10.cluster).

### 5.4.5. Attribute Inheritance

When a structure inherits from another structure, it also inherits the attributes applicable to the parent structure.

#### Basic Attribute Inheritance

Child structures directly inherit attributes from their parent structures:

```mizar
definition
  let M be Magma;
  attr M is associative means
    for x, y, z be Element of M holds
    M.binop(M.binop(x,y),z) = M.binop(x,M.binop(y,z));
end

definition
  struct LoopStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    field binop -> BinOp of carrier;
    property unit -> Element of carrier;
  end

  inherit LoopStr from Magma where
    field carrier from carrier;
    field binop from binop;
  end
end
```

In this example, the `LoopStr` structure inherits from `Magma` so that all `LoopStr`s have the `associative` attribute. As a result, when you declare `let S be LoopStr;`, Mizar automatically recognizes the syntax `S is associative`.

#### Attribute Inheritance Through Inheritance Chains

Attributes are transitively inherited through inheritance chains:

```mizar
definition
  let M be LoopStr;
  attr M is invertible means
    for x be Element of M ex y be Element of M st
    M.binop(x,y) = M.unit & M.binop(y,x) = M.unit;
end

definition
  struct AddLoopStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    field add from binop -> BinOp of carrier;
    property zero from unit -> Element of carrier;
  end

  inherit AddLoopStr from LoopStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    field add from binop;
    property zero from unit;
  end
end
```

In this example, `AddLoopStr` inherits from `LoopStr`, which inherits from `Magma`. As a result, `AddLoopStr` inherits both the `invertible` attribute (from `LoopStr`) and the `associative` attribute (from `Magma`).

#### Resolving Attribute Ambiguity in Multiple Inheritance

In multiple inheritance, ambiguity may arise when attributes with the same name come from different inheritance paths. Mizar provides mechanisms to resolve this ambiguity:

1. **Explicit Resolution Using Type Conversion (qua operator)**:

```mizar
definition
  struct AddLoopStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    field add -> BinOp of the carrier;
    property zero -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  struct MulLoopStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    field mul -> BinOp of the carrier;
    property one -> Element of the carrier;
  end
  
  let L be AddLoopStr;
  attr L is associative means
    for x, y, z be Element of L holds
    L.add(L.add(x,y),z) = L.add(x,L.add(y,z));
  
  let L be MulLoopStr;
  attr L is associative means
    for x, y, z be Element of L holds
    L.mul(L.mul(x,y),z) = L.mul(x,L.mul(y,z));
  
  struct DoubleLoopStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    field add -> BinOp of the carrier;
    field mul -> BinOp of the carrier;
    property zero -> Element of the carrier;
    property one -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  inherit DoubleLoopStr from AddLoopStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    field add from add;
    property zero from zero;
  end

  inherit DoubleLoopStr from MulLoopStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    field mul from mul;
    property one from one;
  end
end
```

To resolve ambiguity, the `qua` operator can be used for type conversion:

```mizar
let DL be DoubleLoopStr;
assume A1: (DL qua AddLoopStr) is associative;  :: Associativity for addition
assume A2: (DL qua MulLoopStr) is associative;  :: Associativity for multiplication
```

2. **Defining Namespaced Attributes**:

For frequently used ambiguous attributes, define explicitly namespaced attributes:

```mizar
definition
  let R be DoubleLoopStr;

  attr R is add_associative means
    (R qua AddLoopStr) is associative;

  attr R is mul_associative means
    (R qua MulLoopStr) is associative;
    
  attr R is distributive means
    for x, y, z be Element of R holds
    R.mul(x, R.add(y,z)) = R.add(R.mul(x,y), R.mul(x,z)) &
    R.mul(R.add(y,z), x) = R.add(R.mul(y,x), R.mul(z,x));
end
```

This eliminates ambiguity when defining mathematical concepts:

```mizar
definition
  mode Ring is add_associative add_commutative 
    mul_associative distributive non degenerated DoubleLoopStr;
end

definition
  let R be Ring;
  attr R is commutative means
    (R qua MulLoopStr) is commutative;
end
```

In this example, when we say a `Ring` is `commutative`, it means commutativity with respect to multiplication.

### 5.4.6. Type Inference with Attributes

Mizar's type inference system uses attributes and clusters to automatically deduce type information:

1. **Direct Inference**:
    ```mizar
    let G be Group;
    thus G is associative;    :: automatically inferred from Group cluster
    ```

2. **Transitive Inference**:
    ```mizar
    let G be associative unital Magma;
    thus G is group-like;     :: inferred through conditional cluster
    ```

3. **Constructor-based Inference**:
    ```mizar
    let A, B be non empty set;
    thus [:A, B:] is non empty;  :: inferred through functorial cluster
    ```

## 5.5. Modes

### 5.5.1. Definition and Purpose of Modes

Modes in Mizar are type constructors that define new types based on existing ones. They serve several key purposes in the type system:

1. **Type Abstraction**: Modes allow for defining abstract mathematical concepts as types, enabling mathematicians to work with familiar mathematical objects directly.

2. **Type Classification**: Modes enable the creation of a rich type hierarchy that mirrors mathematical classification systems.

3. **Type Composition**: Through modes, complex types can be built by composing or restricting existing types.

4. **Dependent Types**: Modes can be parameterized by values, allowing for dependent types that express mathematical relationships.

Modes, along with structures, constitute the radix-types in Mizar's type system. While structures define composite types with explicit fields and properties, modes define types through type expressions and attributes, providing a more abstract approach to type definition.

### 5.5.2. Syntax for Declaring and Using Modes

#### Mode Definition Syntax

Modes in Mizar are defined using the `is` keyword, which specifies how the new type relates to existing types:

```mizar
definition
  mode <mode_name> is <type_expression>;
end
```

where:
- `<mode_name>` is the name of the new mode
- `<type_expression>` is an expression using existing types and attributes

Examples:

```mizar
definition
  mode Integer is integer Number;
  mode Nat is natural Number;
  mode Real is real Number;
end
```

#### Dependent Modes

Modes can be parameterized, creating dependent types that vary based on their parameters:

```mizar
definition
  let X be set;
  mode Element of X-element_like set;
  mode Subset of X is X-subset_like set;
  mode Function of X,Y is quasi_total PartFunc of X,Y;
end
```

The `of` keyword indicates parameter dependencies. The parameters become part of the type's signature.

#### Type Restrictions with Attributes

Attributes can be used to create more specialized modes:

```mizar
definition
  mode Prime is prime Integer;
  mode Group is non empty group_like associative Magma;
end
```

#### Using Modes

Modes are used in variable declarations and type expressions:

```mizar
let G be Group;
let f be Function of REAL, REAL;

theorem
  for n being Integer st n is Prime holds
  n > 1;
```

### 5.5.3. Type Inference with Modes

Mizar's type inference system works with modes to automatically deduce type information:

#### Basic Type Inference

When a variable is declared with a mode, Mizar automatically recognizes its relationship to parent types:

```mizar
let n be Prime;
:: Mizar knows that n is also a Number
```

#### Inference through Attribute Clusters

Type inference also works through attribute clusters:

```mizar
let S be empty set;
:: The cluster registration "cluster empty -> finite set" allows Mizar to infer
:: that S is finite
```

#### Handling Dependent Modes

For dependent modes, type inference ensures proper parameter matching:

```mizar
let X be set;
let S be Subset of X;
:: Mizar knows that S is a set and S ⊆ X
```

### 5.5.4. Mode Implementation

In Mizar's type system, each mode is implemented as a combination of a base type and attribute conditions. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Uniform Type Representation**: All types in Mizar follow a consistent internal representation.

2. **Simplified Type Checking**: Type checking becomes a matter of verifying attribute conditions.

3. **Efficient Type Inference**: Type inference leverages attribute clusters for deducing type relationships.

The internal implementation of a mode declaration:

```mizar
definition
  mode M is <attribute_chain> <type_expressoin>;
end
```

is equivalent to defining:

1. A predicate that verifies whether an object belongs to the mode
2. A cluster registration that establishes the relationship between the mode and its base type with attributes

### 5.5.5. Relationship between Modes and Structures

Modes and structures are complementary type definition mechanisms in Mizar:

1. **Structural vs. Abstract Definition**:
    - Structures define types by explicitly specifying their components (fields and properties)
    - Modes define types through type expressions and attributes, focusing on what an object is rather than how it's composed

2. **Usage Context**:
   - Structures are appropriate for mathematical objects with explicit components (e.g., vector spaces with carriers, operations)
   - Modes are suitable for abstract mathematical concepts or classifications (e.g., prime numbers, continuous functions)

3. **Relationship**:
    - Modes can be defined based on structures: `mode Ring is add_associative mul_associative DoubleLoopStr;`
    - Structures can use modes in field types: `field coefficients -> Sequence of REAL;`

4. **Type Conversion**:
    - Objects of a mode defined from a structure can be converted to the structure using the `qua` operator
    - This allows accessing the structural components when needed

Example of interaction between modes and structures:

```mizar
definition
  struct MetricStruct where
    field carrier -> set;
    field distance -> Function of [:carrier, carrier:], REAL;
  end
end

definition
  mode MetricSpace is reflective discerning symmetric triangle MetricStruct;
end

theorem
  for M being MetricSpace
  for x,y being Element of M
  holds M.distance.(x,y) >= 0;
```

In this example, `MetricSpace` is defined as a mode based on the `MetricStruct` structure with specific attributes.

### 5.5.6. Design Rationale: Unification of Mode Syntax

The redesigned Mizar language adopts a unified approach to mode definition by standardizing on the `is` syntax and removing the legacy `means` syntax. This design decision was made for several compelling reasons:

1. **Simplified Type Inference**:
    - The `is` syntax directly expresses hierarchical relationships between types
    - Type inference becomes more deterministic and follows a clearer pattern
    - The compiler can more efficiently determine subtype relationships

2. **Language Consistency**:
    - A single approach to mode definition creates a more coherent language design
    - Reduces cognitive load for users, as they only need to learn one pattern
    - Creates better alignment with the attribute system

3. **Improved Error Diagnostics**:
    - Allows for more specific and helpful error messages
    - Enables better localization of type errors
    - Simplifies the implementation of the type checking algorithm

4. **Alternative Approaches**:

The functionality previously provided by the `means` syntax can be achieved through combinations of modes and attributes:

a) **Standard Cases**: Most uses of `means` syntax can be directly replaced with attribute definitions:

For example, instead of:
```mizar
definition
mode Prime means
  it is Nat & it > 1 &
  for n being Nat st 1 < n < it holds
  not n divides it;
end
```

The redesigned approach uses:
```mizar
definition
  let n be Nat;
  attr n is prime means
    n > 1 & for m being Nat st 1 < m < n holds
      not m divides n;

  mode Prime is prime Integer;
end
```

b) **Recursive Definitions**: For recursive type definitions, which were previously expressed using `means`, the redesigned Mizar uses a combination of structures and attributes:

```mizar
definition
  struct BinaryTreeNode where
    field value -> object;
    field left -> object;
    field right -> object;
  end
end
  
definition
  let T be object;
  attr T is binary_tree means
    T = {} or
    ex n being BinaryTreeNode st
      T = n & n.left is binary_tree & n.right is binary_tree;
end

definition
  mode BinaryTree is binary_tree set;
end

definition
  let T be BinaryTree;
  mode Leaf of T is terminal Element of T;
end
```

This approach maintains the full expressivity of the previous system while bringing greater consistency and clarity to the type system.

The redesigned Mizar's unified approach to mode definition maintains the full expressive power of the language while improving its coherence, implementability, and user experience.

## 5.6. Type Inference and Checking

### 5.6.1. Basic Type Inference

Mizar's type system includes automatic type inference capabilities that work in conjunction with the clustering mechanism and inheritance relationships:

```mizar
let G be Group;
reconsider M = G as Magma;  :: Group is automatically inferred as compatible with Magma
```

### 5.6.2. Type Conversion Overview

Mizar supports both implicit and explicit type conversions:

1. **Implicit Conversions**: Automatically performed based on:
    - Inheritance relationships (upcast conversions)
    - Clustering rules (attribute-based inference)
    - Constructor definitions

2. **Explicit Conversions**: User-controlled conversions using:
    - `qua` operator for type disambiguation
    - `reconsider` statement for type refinement with proof obligations

### 5.6.3. Type Checking Process

Mizar performs type checking by:

1. Verifying syntactic type correctness
2. Generating proof obligations for type assertions
3. Resolving inheritance-based type relationships
4. Applying clustering rules for type inference
