## 7.1. Definition and Purpose

Attributes are unary predicates used to refine types by specifying additional logical properties. They serve the following purposes:

1. **Subtype Refinement**: Define subtypes of existing types based on logical conditions.
2. **Property Annotation**: Attach properties to types in a modular and reusable way.
3. **Type Inference**: Participate in the clustering mechanism for automatic type derivation.

## 7.2. Syntax for Attribute Declaration

Attributes are defined using the `attr` keyword:

```mizar
definition
  let T be Type;
  attr T is attr_name means
    <logical_condition>;
end
```

Attributes may also be parameterized:

```mizar
definition
  let n be Nat;
  attr V is n-dimensional means
    ex B being Basis of V st card B = n;
end
```

Syntax for multiple parameters:

```mizar
definition
  let m, n be Nat;
  attr A is (m,n)-size means ...;
end
```

## 7.3. Usage

### Type Qualification

```mizar
let G be associative unital Magma;
let n be positive even Integer;
```

### Property Testing

```mizar
assume M is commutative;
if n is odd then ...;
```

### Negation and Combinations

```mizar
let S be non empty finite set;
```

### Type-Qualified Attributes

Used to disambiguate multiple inheritance:

```mizar
R is AddLoopStr.associative;
R is MulLoopStr.commutative;
```

Alternatively, the `qua` operator may be used:

```mizar
(R qua AddLoopStr) is associative;
(R qua MulLoopStr) is commutative;
```

## 7.4. Clustering Mechanism

Clustering enables automatic propagation of attributes.

* **Existential Cluster**: Declares that some object of the type with the attribute exists.

```mizar
registration
  cluster empty finite set;
  existence
  proof
    ...;
  end
end
```

* **Conditional Cluster**: Declares implication between attributes.

```mizar
registration
  cluster empty -> finite set;
  coherence
  proof
    ...;
  end
end
```

## 7.5. Attribute Inheritance

Attributes are inherited along structure inheritance paths.

```mizar
inherit LoopStr from Magma where
  field carrier from carrier;
  field binop from binop;
end
```

In this case, a `LoopStr` inherits attributes defined for `Magma`.

## 7.6. Disambiguation in Multiple Inheritance

Use qualified syntax to avoid ambiguity:

```mizar
R is AddLoopStr.associative;
R is MulLoopStr.associative;
```

Alternatively, define disambiguated attributes:

```mizar
definition
  let R be DoubleLoopStr;
  attr R is add_associative means R is AddLoopStr.associative;
end
```

## 7.7. Redefinition

To redefine an attribute for a specialized type:

```mizar
definition
  let n be Nat;
  redefine attr n is even means ex k be Nat st n = 2*k;
  coherence with even_for_integer;
  proof
    :: for Nat, divisibility and multiplication-based definitions coincide
    ...;
  end
end
```

A label such as `:even_for_integer:` can be given to the original definition for reference.

Requirements:

* Logical equivalence with the original definition
* Coherence proof to justify redefinition
* (Optional) use of labels to disambiguate when redefining based on specific parent definition

## 7.8. Implementation Notes

* Attributes are internally treated as unary predicates.
* Clustering generates proof obligations automatically.
* Type inference relies heavily on clustering and attribute propagation.
* Multiple inheritance paths must be explicitly resolved to avoid ambiguity.
* `qua` operator remains available for manual disambiguation in complex type coercions.
