## 9.1. Basic Type Inference

Mizar's type system includes automatic type inference capabilities that work in conjunction with the clustering mechanism and inheritance relationships:

```mizar
let G be Group;
reconsider M = G as Magma;  :: Group is automatically inferred as compatible with Magma
```

## 9.2. Type Conversion Overview

Mizar supports both implicit and explicit type conversions:

1. **Implicit Conversions**: Automatically performed based on:
    - Inheritance relationships (upcast conversions)
    - Clustering rules (attribute-based inference)
    - Constructor definitions

2. **Explicit Conversions**: User-controlled conversions using:
    - `qua` operator for type disambiguation
    - `reconsider` statement for type refinement with proof obligations

## 9.3. Type Checking Process

Mizar performs type checking by:

1. Verifying syntactic type correctness
2. Generating proof obligations for type assertions
3. Resolving inheritance-based type relationships
4. Applying clustering rules for type inference
