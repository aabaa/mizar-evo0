## 9.1. Basic Type Inference

Type inference is based on inheritance, attribute clusters, and structural compatibility.

```mizar
let G be Group;
reconsider M = G as Magma;  :: Group is inferred to be a Magma
```

Declarations (`let`), `reconsider`, and mode applications all use the inference engine.

## 9.2. Type Conversion

Two kinds of conversions are supported: implicit and explicit.

### 9.2.1. Implicit Conversion

Automatically applied by the verifier:

* Upcasting (e.g., `Group` â†’ `Magma`)
* Attribute implications via clustering
* Mode/structure-based compatibility

### 9.2.2. Explicit Conversion

Used when inference is insufficient or ambiguous:

* **`qua` operator**:

  ```mizar
  (R qua AddLoopStr) is associative;
  ```

* **`reconsider` statement**:

  ```mizar
  reconsider f as Function of X, Y;
  ```

These may trigger proof obligations to ensure type validity.

## 9.3. Type Checking Process

1. Parse type declarations and usage
2. Generate proof obligations for conversions
3. Resolve inheritance and attribute clusters
4. Apply conversions (implicit/explicit)

Type checking guarantees semantic coherence of all terms.
