# 11. Functors

## 11.1. Overview and Syntax

Functors introduce symbolic functions using the `func` keyword:

```mizar
definition
  let X, Y be set;
  func X \/ Y -> set means
    for z being object holds z in it iff z in X or z in Y;
end
```

* `it` denotes the return value.
* Return type is specified after `->`.
* Functor symbols can be arbitrary non-whitespace character sequences.
* Lexical analysis follows the longest-match rule and import-sensitive symbol resolution. In case of conflicts between modules, fully qualified names or aliasing must be used to disambiguate symbol references.

## 11.2. Definition Styles: `equals` vs `means`

Mizar supports two styles of functor definitions:

* **`equals`**: Provides an explicit value. The system considers the functor well-defined by construction, so no additional proofs are needed.

```mizar
func twice(n) -> Nat equals 2 * n;
```

* **`means`**: Specifies the defining condition for the result, using `it` as a placeholder. This style requires the user to prove that a unique such result exists, using `existence` and `uniqueness` blocks.

```mizar
definition
  let x, y be Real;
  func x / y -> Real means it * y = x;
  existence
  proof ... end;
  uniqueness
  proof ... end;
end;
```

Use `means` when the value cannot be defined constructively or involves complex conditions.

## 11.3. Partial Functions and `assume`

`assume` clauses constrain the domain of definition:

```mizar
definition
  let x, y be Real;
  assume y <> 0;
  func x / y -> Real means it * y = x;
end
```

* Outside the assumed domain, result is undefined.
* Definedness checking is more complex than type checking. Therefore, it is recommended to encode preconditions such as `y ≠ 0` into the argument types when possible—for example, by requiring `y` to be a non-zero Real. This improves clarity and reduces the burden on semantic verification.

## 11.4. Dependent Return Types

Return types can depend on input values. Such dependent return types may affect type inference and require explicit annotations or proof obligations during verification:

```mizar
definition
  let G be Group;
  func center(G) -> Subgroup of G means ...
end
```

Multiple dependencies are supported:

```mizar
definition
  let H, K be Subgroup of G;
  func H * K -> Subset of G means ...
end
```

## 11.5. Redefinition and Type Refinement

Return types can be specialized via `redefine`:

```mizar
definition
  let x be Real;
  func |.x.| -> Real means ...;
end

definition
  let x be non negative Real;
  redefine func |.x.| -> non negative Real means it = x;
  coherence with abs_general
  proof ... end
end
```

* The redefined type must be a subtype of the original. Subtyping is determined by structural inclusion, attribute implication, or explicit registration via the clustering mechanism.
* All previous uses must remain type-safe. For example, redefining a functor with a stricter return type such as `positive Integer` from `Integer` will fail if the functor is used in a context that allows non-positive integers.

## 11.6. Correctness Conditions

* Functors defined via `means` require `existence` and `uniqueness` proofs.
* Functors defined via `equals` are well-defined by construction.

## 11.7. Notation Styles

Supported notations:

* **Infix**: `func x + y`
* **Prefix**: `func - x`
* **Postfix**: `func n !`
* **Bracket**: `func [: X, Y :]`

Examples:

```mizar
func n ! -> Nat equals Product(id(Seg n));
```

## 11.8. Operator Precedence and Associativity

Declared via annotations:

```mizar
@symbol_precedence(+, 80, left_associative);
```

* Range: 0–255 (default: 64)
* Must be consistent across modules. Precedence consistency is checked statically during the module linking phase. Any conflict results in a descriptive link-time error.
* Conflicting declarations cause link-time errors

Associativity types:

* `left_associative`: `(x + y) + z`
* `right_associative`: `x ^ (y ^ z)`
* `non_associative`: e.g., relational operators
