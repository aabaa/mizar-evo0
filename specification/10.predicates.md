# 10. Predicates

## 10.1 Predicate Declarations

Predicates express properties and relations. Each predicate has a name, typed parameters, and a logical definition.

```mizar
definition
  let X, Y be set;
  pred X c= Y means
    for x being object st x in X holds x in Y;
end;
```

Types are enforced on parameters. Predicates must yield boolean values.

Predicates can be:

* **Built-in**: e.g., `x in X`, `x = y`, `x <> y`
* **User-defined**: declared with `pred` and `means`
* **Overloaded**: disambiguated by parameter types

## 10.2 Dependent and Typed Parameters

Parameter types can depend on earlier parameters:

```mizar
definition
  let G be Group;
  let H be Subgroup of G;
  let a, b be Element of G;
  pred a, b are_congruent_mod H means
    a * b" in H;
end;
```

You may also constrain types using attributes:

```mizar
definition
  let G be non empty associative Magma;
  let a, b be Element of G;
  pred a, b are_commute means
    G.binop(a, b) = G.binop(b, a);
end;
```

## 10.3 Predicate Redefinition

Existing predicates can be redefined for more specific types. This improves clarity and removes redundant conditions.

```mizar
definition
  let x be object, f be Function;
  pred x is_a_fixpoint_of f means
    :fixpoint_general: x in dom f & x = f.x;
end;

definition
  let A be non empty set, a be Element of A, f be Function of A, A;
  redefine pred a is_a_fixpoint_of f means
    a = f.a;
  coherence with fixpoint_general
  proof
    :: dom f = A, so membership is implied
  end;
end;
```

Redefinition syntax:

* Use `redefine pred`
* Refer to original using a label (e.g., `:fixpoint_general:`)
* Provide a `coherence` proof to show logical equivalence

## 10.4 Symbol Resolution and Imports

User-defined predicates are made available by importing their defining modules. Conflicts between names are resolved by:

* **Longest-match rule** during lexing
* **Qualified names** when needed:

```mizar
import algebra.group as grp;
let G be set;
assume G is grp.subgroup_of;
```

Ambiguous symbols can also be resolved using the `qua` operator when involving structural types, though this is more common in functor or expression contexts.

Note: Predicate symbols must be unambiguous only when they are actually used.
