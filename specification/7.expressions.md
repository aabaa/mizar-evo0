## 7.1. Primary Expressions

Primary expressions are the most fundamental syntactic elements in Mizar's expression system. They represent atomic values, references, and basic constructs that form the building blocks for more complex expressions.

### 7.1.1. Variable Identifiers

A variable identifier refers to a variable declared in the current scope.

**Syntax** (as defined in [2.6.1](./2.lexical_structure.md#261-syntax-and-usage)):

```bnf
Identifier = (Letter | "_") { Letter | Digit | "_" | "'" } .
Letter = "A" | "B" | ... | "Z" | "a" | "b" | ... | "z" .
Digit  = "0" | "1" | ... | "9" .
```

**Resolution Order**: A variable identifier is resolved according to the following scoping rules:

1. The innermost proof-level declarations
2. Outer proof scopes
3. Module-level `reserve` declarations

**Example**:

```mizar
reserve x for Real;

theorem
  for x being Nat holds x >= 0
proof
  let x be Nat;  :: `x` here refers to the Nat variable
  x >= 0;
end;
```

### 7.1.3. The `it` Keyword

The keyword `it` is a special identifier used only within function definitions to refer to the result being defined.

**Syntax**:

```bnf
"it"
```

**Permitted Context**:

* Within a `func` block (function definitions)

**Example**:

```mizar
definition
  let X, Y be set;
  func X \/ Y -> set means
    for z be object holds z in it iff z in X or z in Y;
end;
```

**Restrictions**:

* `it` may only be used to refer to the object currently being defined.
* Usage of `it` outside a definition block results in an error.

### 7.1.4. Parenthesized Expressions

Parenthesized expressions allow grouping of sub-expressions to override default operator precedence or improve readability.

**Syntax:**
```bnf
"(" Term-Expression ")"
```

**Purpose:**
1. **Precedence override:**
   ```mizar
   (a + b) * c      :: Addition performed before multiplication
   a * (b + c)      :: Grouping for clarity
   ```

2. **Complex expression grouping:**
   ```mizar
   ((a + b) * c) / (d - e)
   ```

3. **Readability improvement:**
   ```mizar
   (x > 0) & (y > 0)    :: Logical grouping for clarity
   ```

**Nesting:**
Arbitrary levels of nesting are supported:
```mizar
(((a + b) * c) + (d / (e - f)))
```

**Type preservation:**
Parenthesized expressions preserve the type of their contained expression:
```mizar
let x be Real;
let result = (x + 1);    :: result has type Real
```

**Note:** While parentheses can always be used for grouping, they are only necessary when the default precedence rules would produce different results. See [Section 7.7: Operator Precedence and Associativity](#77-operator-precedence-and-associativity) for detailed precedence rules.

## 7.2. Functor Applications

Functor applications form the core of Mizar's expression system, allowing the construction of new terms through the application of user-defined or imported functors. Functors can be declared using either `func` or `deffunc`. All functor applications are resolved using the longest-match rule and are subject to type checking.

### 7.2.1. Classification of Functors

Mizar provides two forms of functor definition:

* **Symbolic functors**, declared using the `func` keyword. These are formally defined with a full specification of argument types, return type, and (optionally) existence and uniqueness conditions. They may be associated with infix, prefix, postfix, or bracket notation.
* **Inline functors**, defined using the `deffunc` keyword. These serve as concise local definitions and are always applied in prefix form. Inline functors are intended for use within proof blocks and are not exported.

Each functor has an arity and return type, and may be overloaded. Symbolic functors declared with `func` enable expressive, mathematical syntax.

### 7.2.2. Symbolic Functor Applications

Symbolic functor applications use notational forms such as infix, prefix, postfix, or bracket.

**Syntax:**

```bnf
Term-Expression ::= [Arguments] Functor-Symbol [Arguments]
Arguments ::= Term-Expression | "(" Term-Expression { "," Term-Expression } ")"
```

**Examples:**

```mizar
x + y       :: infix
- x         :: prefix
x!          :: postfix
[: a, b :]  :: bracket
```

**Semantics:**

* Symbolic functors are defined with explicit syntax declarations using `func`.
* If a functor takes multiple arguments on either side, the arguments **must** be grouped using parentheses.
* Precedence and associativity rules govern parsing of complex expressions (see ยง7.7).
* The lexer uses the longest-match rule when multiple functor symbols may apply.

### 7.2.3. Inline Functor Applications

Inline functors defined by `deffunc` are lightweight, local definitions intended for use within proof blocks.

**Definition Syntax:**

```mizar
deffunc <name>(<arg1 be Type1>, ..., <argN be TypeN>) -> <ReturnType> equals <term>;
```

**Application Syntax:**

```mizar
<name>(<expr1>, ..., <exprN>)
```

**Example:**

```mizar
proof
  deffunc add3(a be Nat, b be Nat, c be Nat) -> Nat equals a + b + c;
  ...
  add3(1, 2, 3);  :: used within a proof block
end;
```

**Semantics:**

* Inline functors are valid only within proof blocks.
* Arguments and return types must match the declared signature.
* The use of `equals` ensures direct substitution without the need for existence or uniqueness proofs.

### 7.2.4. Functor Name Disambiguation

When multiple symbolic functors share the same name, disambiguation can be achieved using module-qualified names.

**Example:**

```mizar
group.add(x, y)
mml.algebra.group.mul(a, b)
```

**Semantics:**

* Dot notation is used to specify the defining module of a symbolic functor.
* This allows precise reference to the intended functor when multiple variants exist.

See ยง3 for details on module paths and namespace resolution.

### 7.2.5. Resolution and Precedence Notes

Operator precedence and associativity govern the grouping of expressions involving symbolic functors.

**Example:**

```mizar
a + b * c    :: parsed as a + (b * c) if * has higher precedence than +
```

The detailed rules for precedence and associativity are given in ยง7.7.

**Disambiguation Rule:**

* The longest-match rule applies when more than one functor symbol is applicable at the same position.
* Parentheses may be used to override default parsing behavior explicitly.

**Recommendation:**

* Use parentheses liberally when complex or nested expressions may lead to ambiguity.
* Use module-qualified names to clarify functor identity when needed.

## 7.3. Structure Expressions

Structure expressions allow the creation and manipulation of structured data based on user-defined structure types. This section describes how to construct structures and access their fields.

### 7.3.1. Structure Constructor

Structure values are constructed by providing values for each of the structure's fields in a named form.

**Syntax:**

```mizar
StructName(field1: value1, field2: value2, ..., fieldN: valueN)
```

**Example:**

```mizar
Point(x: 1, y: 2)
Rectangle(width: 10, height: 5)
```

**Semantics:**

* Each field must be assigned exactly once.
* All fields defined in the structure must be provided unless default values are specified.
* Field names and types must match the structure's declaration.
* Field order is irrelevant due to named parameters.

**Type Checking:**

* Each `value_i` must have a type compatible with the declared type of `field_i`.
* Type coercions (if defined) may be applied automatically when enabled.

**Restrictions:**

* Duplicate field names are not allowed.
* No extra or undeclared fields may be specified.

Subsequent sections discuss how to access fields from constructed structure values.
