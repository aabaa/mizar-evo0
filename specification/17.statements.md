## 17.1 Overview

Statements in Mizar form the building blocks of mathematical reasoning. They appear within various contexts including theorem proofs and auxiliary reasoning blocks. This chapter describes all statement forms, their syntax, semantics, and proper usage.

Statements can be broadly categorized into:
- **Declarative statements**: Introduce variables, constants, or assumptions
- **Justification statements**: Assert propositions with supporting evidence
- **Structural statements**: Organize proof flow and reasoning patterns
- **Type-related statements**: Handle type conversions and reinterpretations

## 17.2 Variable and Constant Introduction

### 17.2.1 Generalization Statement (`let`)

The `let` statement introduces universally quantified variables with optional constraints.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
generalization: "let" variable_list qualification? ("such" conditions)? ";"
variable_list: identifier ("," identifier)*
qualification: ("being" | "be") type_expr
conditions: "that" proposition ("and" proposition)*
```

**Examples:**
```mizar
let x be Real;
let y, z be Real such that y < z;
let G be Group;
let H be Subgroup of G;
let n be Nat such that n > 0 and n is prime;
```

**Semantics:**
- In proof contexts: introduces arbitrary but fixed values
- In definition contexts: introduces parameters for the definition
- Variables are not recommended to shadow existing variables
- The `such that` clause adds assumptions about the introduced variables
- Multiple variables are allowed only when they share the same type

### 17.2.2 Constant Definition (`set`)

The `set` statement introduces abbreviations for terms.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
constant_definition: "set" identifier "=" term_expr ";"
```

**Examples:**
```mizar
set x = a + b;
set y = f.x;
set n = card X;
```

**Semantics:**
- Creates syntactic abbreviations expanded during verification
- The type is inferred from the right-hand side expression
- No label is needed (labels are for propositions, not definitions)
- Only single assignments are allowed

### 17.2.3 Inline Function Definition (`deffunc`)

Defines local function abbreviations within proofs.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
inline_functor_definition: "deffunc" identifier "(" typed_params ")" "->" type_expr "equals" term_expr ";"
typed_params: typed_param ("," typed_param)*
typed_param: identifier "be" type_expr
```

**Example:**
```mizar
proof
  deffunc F(n be Nat) -> Nat equals n * (n + 1);
  deffunc G(x be Real, y be Real) -> Real equals x^2 + y^2;
  ...
  F(n) = n * (n + 1);  :: by definition
end;
```

### 17.2.4 Inline Predicate Definition (`defpred`)

Defines local predicate abbreviations within proofs.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
inline_predicate_definition: "defpred" identifier "(" typed_params? ")" "means" formula ";"
```

**Example:**
```mizar
proof
  defpred P(n be Nat) means n is prime & n > 2;
  defpred Q(x be Real, y be Real) means x < y & y < x + 1;
  ...
  P(n) implies n is odd;
end;
```

## 17.3 Assumptions and Assertions

### 17.3.1 Single Assumption (`assume`)

Introduces a single proposition as an assumption.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
single_assumption: "assume" proposition ";"
proposition: (label_identifier ":")? formula
```

**Examples:**
```mizar
assume x > 0;
assume A1: G is abelian;
```

### 17.3.2 Collective Assumption (`assume that`)

Introduces multiple related assumptions.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
collective_assumption: "assume" conditions ";"
conditions: "that" proposition ("and" proposition)*
```

**Example:**
```mizar
assume that A1: x > 0
        and A2: y > 0
        and x < y;
```

### 17.3.3 Existential Assumption (`given`)

Introduces existentially quantified variables with properties.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
existential_assumption: "given" variable_list qualification? ("such" conditions)? ";"
```

**Examples:**
```mizar
given x being Real such that x^2 = 2;
given G being Group such that G is finite and card G = p;
```

**Semantics:**
- Introduces Skolem constants satisfying the given conditions
- Equivalent to existential instantiation in natural deduction
- Multiple variables are allowed only when they share the same type

### 17.3.4 Choice Statement (`consider`)

Introduces a variable satisfying conditions with justification.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
choice_statement: "consider" identifier qualification "such" conditions simple_justification ";"
```

**Example:**
```mizar
consider x being Real such that x > 0 and f.x = 0 by A1, Th5;
```

**Note:** Only single variable introduction is allowed.

## 17.4 Conclusions and Derivations

### 17.4.1 Direct Conclusion (`thus`)

Asserts a proposition with justification.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
conclusion: "thus" proposition justification ";"
```

**Examples:**
```mizar
thus A3: x > 0 by A1, A2;
thus thesis by Lemma1, Def3;
```

### 17.4.2 Sequential Conclusion (`hence`)

Equivalent to `then thus`, emphasizes derivation from immediately preceding statements.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
conclusion: "hence" proposition justification ";"
```

### 17.4.3 Block Conclusion (`hereby`)

Introduces a reasoning block whose result serves as justification.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
diffuse_conclusion: "hereby" reasoning "end"
```

**Example:**
```mizar
hereby
  assume x > 0;
  then x^2 > 0 by Th1;
  hence thesis;
end;
```

### 17.4.4 Witness Introduction (`take`)

Provides a witness for existential claims.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
exemplification: "take" example ";"
example: term_expr | identifier "=" term_expr
```

**Examples:**
```mizar
take 0;
take x = a + b;
```

**Note:** Only single witness introduction is allowed.

## 17.5 Type Management

### 17.5.1 Type Reconsideration (`reconsider`)

Changes the type view of a term with justification.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
type_changing_statement: "reconsider" reconsider_item "as" type_expr simple_justification ";"
reconsider_item: identifier | identifier "=" term_expr
```

**Examples:**
```mizar
reconsider x as Element of NAT by A1;
reconsider f = F|A as Function of A, B by Th3;
```

**Note:** Only single reconsideration is allowed per statement.

### 17.5.2 Term Reduction (`reduce`)

Simplifies terms to canonical forms automatically (part of registration blocks).

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
reduction_registration: "reduce" term_expr "to" term_expr ";" correctness_conditions
```

**Example:**
```mizar
registration
  let n be Nat;
  reduce n + 0 to n;
  reducibility;
end;
```

## 17.6 Proof Organization

### 17.6.1 Labeled Reasoning Block (`now`)

Creates a labeled sub-proof for later reference.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
diffuse_statement: (label_identifier ":")? "now" reasoning "end"
```

**Example:**
```mizar
A1: now
  assume x > 0;
  then x^2 > 0 by Square_positive;
  thus P[x];
end;
```

### 17.6.2 Case Analysis (`case`)

Structures reasoning by cases with justification.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
case_item: "case" (proposition | conditions) ";" reasoning "end"
```

Used within `per cases`:
```mizar
thus P[n]
proof
  per cases by NAT_IND;
  case n = 0;
    thus thesis by Base_case;
  end;
  case n > 0;
    thus thesis by Inductive_step;
  end;
end;
```

### 17.6.3 Supposition (`suppose`)

Alternative case introduction.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
suppose_item: "suppose" (proposition | conditions) ";" reasoning "end"
```

**Example:**
```mizar
per cases;
suppose A1: x > 0;
  thus thesis by A1, Positive_case;
end;
suppose A2: x <= 0;
  thus thesis by A2, Non_positive_case;
end;
```

## 17.7 Iterative Equality

Chains equality reasoning steps with intermediate justifications.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
iterative_equality: (label_identifier ":")? term_expr "=" term_expr simple_justification 
                   (".=" term_expr simple_justification)* ";"
```

**Example:**
```mizar
A1: f.(x + y) = f.x + f.y by Additive
             .= g.x + f.y by A2
             .= g.x + g.y by A3;
```

**Semantics:**
- Each step must be justified
- Creates a chain of equalities
- The label (if present) refers to the entire chain
- Not an assignment but a justified equality assertion

## 17.8 Justification Forms

### 17.8.1 Simple Justification

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
?simple_justification: ("by" references)?
references: reference ("," reference)*
```

**Examples:**
```mizar
by A1, A2;
by mml.algebra.group.Lagrange_theorem;
by Math_induction[n, n^2 >= n];
by Well_founded_induction[Nat, <, P];
```

**Note:** References can now include:
- Local identifiers (labels and theorem names within the current proof)
- Qualified references using namespace paths
- Template instantiations for parameterized theorems (replacing the old scheme mechanism)

### 17.8.2 Full Proof

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
proof: "proof" reasoning "end"
```

## 17.9 Statement Modifiers

### 17.9.1 Sequential Modifier (`then`)

The `then` modifier indicates direct derivation from the immediately preceding statement.

**Syntax (Lark):**
```lark
statement: "then"? linkable_statement | diffuse_statement
```

**Example:**
```mizar
assume x > 0;
then x^2 > 0 by Square_positive;
then hence x^2 + 1 > 1;
```

## 17.10 Scoping and Context Rules

1. **Variable Scope**: Variables introduced by `let` are scoped to their enclosing block. While not enforced, unique variables within a block are strongly recommended.
2. **Label Scope**: Labels are scoped to their enclosing reasoning block. While not enforced, unique labels within a block are strongly recommended.
3. **Definition Context**: In definition blocks, `let` introduces definition parameters
4. **Proof Context**: In proof blocks, `let` introduces arbitrary fixed values
5. **Inline Definitions**: `deffunc` and `defpred` are scoped to their proof block
