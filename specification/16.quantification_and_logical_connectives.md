This chapter describes the remaining logical formula constructs not covered in the former chapter, based on the following Lark grammar:

```lark
?formula: "(" formula ")"
        | atomic
        | quantified
        | formula "&" formula               -> and
        | formula "&" "..." "&" formula     -> and_multi
        | formula "or" formula              -> or
        | formula "or" "..." "or" formula   -> or_multi
        | formula "implies" formula         -> implies
        | formula "iff" formula             -> iff
        | "not" formula                     -> not
        | "contradiction"
        | "thesis"
```

Among these, `quantified`, `and`, `or`, `implies`, `iff`, `not`, and the multi-connective variants are newly introduced here.

## 16.1 Logical Connectives

Logical connectives allow the construction of compound formulas by combining simpler ones.

### Conjunction (`&`, `& ... &`)

```lark
formula "&" formula               -> and
formula "&" "..." "&" formula     -> and_multi
```

Binary conjunction represents logical "and" and is left-associative by default:

```mizar
x is Nat & x > 0;
```

The `& ... &` form is a special repetition syntax to represent a series of similar conjuncts over a range of integer values. For example:

```mizar
assume m <> 0 & ... & m <> 3;
```

This is interpreted as a shorthand for:

```mizar
assume m <> 0 & m <> 1 & m <> 2 & m <> 3;
```

### Disjunction (`or`, `or ... or`)

```lark
formula "or" formula              -> or
formula "or" "..." "or" formula   -> or_multi
```

Disjunctions represent logical "or".&#x20;

```mizar
x = 0 or x = 1;
x mod 2 = 0 or ... or x mod 7 = 0;
```

### Implication (`implies`)

```lark
formula "implies" formula         -> implies
```

Represents logical implication (if-then).&#x20;

```mizar
x > 0 implies x^2 > 0;
```

### Bi-implication (`iff`)

```lark
formula "iff" formula             -> iff
```

Represents logical equivalence.

```mizar
x in A iff x is Element of A;
```

### Negation (`not`)

```lark
"not" formula                     -> not
```

Unary operator representing logical negation. It binds more tightly than any binary connective.

```mizar
not x in A;
not (x > 0 or y < 0);
```

Note: syntactic forms like `x is not finite` are allowed instead of  `not (x is finite)`.

### Grouping with Parentheses

Parentheses can override the default association and grouping of connectives.

```mizar
not x > 0 & y > 0;  -- parsed as (not x > 0) & y > 0
(a or b) implies c;
```

To avoid ambiguity, parentheses are strongly recommended around compound subformulas.

## 16.2 Quantified Formula Expressions

```lark
quantified: "for" qualified_vars ["st" formula] ("holds" formula | quantified)
          | "ex" qualified_vars "st" formula
```

Quantified formulas express logical universality (`for`) and existentiality (`ex`).

### Universal Quantification (`for`)

```mizar
for x being Nat holds x + 1 > x;
```

An optional `st` condition may restrict the range of variables:

```mizar
for x being Real st x > 0 holds x^2 > 0;
```

Nesting is allowed:

```mizar
for x being Real st x > 0
  for y being Real st y > x
    holds x + y > 0;
```

### Existential Quantification (`ex`)

```mizar
ex n being Nat st n > 100;
```

States that there exists a value of the given type satisfying the condition.

### Qualified Variable Syntax

```lark
qualified_vars: implicit_vars
              | explicit_vars
              | explicit_vars "," implicit_vars

explicit_vars: qualified_segment ("," qualified_segment)*
qualified_segment: var_list qualification
qualification: ("being" | "be") type
```

Examples:

```mizar
for x, y being Real holds ...;
for a being Nat, b holds ...;  -- b is typed by "reserve" syntax
```

Variable types may be omitted if they are declared via `reserve`.

## 16.3 Associativity and Grouping Guidelines

* `not` binds more tightly than `&` and `or`.
* `&`, `or`,Â `implies` and `iff`are left-associative.
* Grouping with parentheses is strongly encouraged for clarity.

**Examples:**

```mizar
not x > 0 & y > 0;         -- parsed as (not x > 0) & y > 0
a or b implies c;          -- parsed as (a or b) implies c
(x implies y) implies z;   -- parenthesized for clarity
```

This chapter completes the logical formula syntax by introducing quantifiers and logical connectives. These constructs enable structured expression of logical reasoning necessary for theorem formulation and proof.
