# 6. Structures

## 6.1 Concept and Purpose

Structures are radix-types used to define composite types with named fields and properties. They serve three purposes:

1. **Data encapsulation**: grouping logically related components
2. **Type formation**: creating new types via structural definitions
3. **Mathematical modeling**: representing algebraic and analytical structures

## 6.2 Syntax

Structure definitions use the `struct` keyword:

```mizar
definition
  struct Name where
    field field1 -> Type1;
    ...
    property prop1 -> Type2;
    ...
  end
end
```

* `field`: represents intrinsic components
* `property`: represents derived values (often from functors)
* Property values are typically computed from the fields via functors.

**Example**:

```mizar
definition
  struct UnitalMagma where
    field carrier -> set;
    field binop -> BinOp of carrier;
    property unit -> Element of carrier;
  end
end
```

## 6.3 Inheritance

Structures may inherit from others via `inherit`:

```mizar
definition
  inherit Derived from Base where
    field derived_field from base_field;
    property derived_prop from base_prop;
  end
end
```

* All base fields/properties must be inherited.
* Inheritance supports renaming and type specialization with proof obligations.
* When the type of an inherited field or property is specialized, one must prove type consistency (e.g., `for x being X holds x is Y`).

**Set inheritance** is allowed:

```mizar
inherit 1-sorted from set where
  field carrier from it;
end
```

## 6.4 Multiple and Diamond Inheritance

Multiple inheritance is allowed if structure names are distinct. Diamond inheritance is supported but must be disambiguated.

**Example**:

```mizar
definition
  struct ZeroStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property zero -> Element of carrier;
  end

  struct OneStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property one -> Element of carrier;
  end

  struct ZeroOneStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property zero -> Element of carrier;
    property one -> Element of carrier;
  end

  inherit ZeroOneStr from ZeroStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property zero from zero;
  end

  inherit ZeroOneStr from OneStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property one from one;
  end
end
```

Consistency of shared fields (e.g., `carrier`) must be proven.

## 6.5 Constructors

Structures can be instantiated using default or custom constructors.

* **Default**: named arguments in any order. The order of fields does not matter due to the named argument syntax.

```mizar
let x = OneStr(carrier: A, one: b);
```

* **Custom**: using `constructor` keyword

```mizar
definition
  let G be Group;
  constructor OneStr(G) where
    it.carrier = G.carrier;
    it.one = G.unit;
  end
end
```

* **Converting constructors** allow implicit type coercion:

```mizar
reconsider x = G as OneStr;
```

## 6.6 Dependent Structures

Structures can be parameterized using `over` or `of`:

```mizar
definition
  let R be Ring;
  struct Polynomial over R where
    field coeffs -> FinSequence of R.carrier;
    property degree -> Nat;
  end
end
```

* These forms are syntactic sugar for template definitions.
* Multiple parameters: `struct Name over T, U`
* These declarations enable instantiation and specialization as generic structures.

**Usage**:

```mizar
let p be Polynomial over REAL;
```

This enables modular and reusable structure definitions parameterized by types.
