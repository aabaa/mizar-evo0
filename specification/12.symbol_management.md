## 12.1. Synonyms and Antonyms

Mizar allows the definition of **synonyms** and **antonyms** for predicates, functors, modes, and attributes.

### Examples

* **Predicates**

  ```mizar
  pred a < b means ...;
  synonym b > a for a < b;
  antonym b >= a for a < b;
  ```

* **Functors**

  ```mizar
  func f" -> Function means ...;
  synonym inv f for f";  :: must follow the original definition
  ```

* **Modes**

  ```mizar
  mode FinSequence of G is ...;
  synonym FinSeq of G for FinSequence of G;
  ```

* **Attributes**

  ```mizar
  attr R is commutative means ...;
  synonym R is abel for R is commutative;

  attr a is finite means ...;
  antonym a is infinite for a is finite;
  ```

#### Benefits

* Support for alternative mathematical notations and word orders
* Natural expression of negation without explicit "not"
* Maintain semantic equivalence while improving readability
* Improve compatibility with mathematical conventions

## 12.2. Scope and Visibility

### Scope Hierarchy

* **Module-level definitions** are visible throughout the module:

  ```mizar
  pred x divides y means ...;
  ```

* **Imported symbols** are made available via `import`:

  ```mizar
  import mml.algebra.group;
  ```

### Precedence Rules

* Local definitions take precedence over imported symbols
* Redefinitions require the `redefine` keyword
* Identifiers override symbol names when forming valid patterns

## 12.3. Import Behavior and Conflict Resolution

### Import Syntax

```mizar
import mml.algebra.group;
import mml.topology.space as top;
```

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

1. **Namespace Qualification**

   ```mizar
   let G be algebra.group.Group;
   let T be top_group.Group;
   ```

2. **Module Precedence**

   ```mizar
   :: Suppose mml.set_theory.cardinal defines:
   :: pred A card_leq B means card A <= card B;
   import mml.set_theory.cardinal;

   pred A card_leq B means ...;  :: Local redefinition takes precedence
   ```

3. **Longest-Match Rule**

   This applies during lexical analysis

   * When `+` and `++` are defined, `a++b` is parsed as `++`


## 12.4. Public and Private Symbols

### Visibility Defaults

* `pred`, `func`, `mode`, `attr`, `struct`, `theorem` are public unless declared `private`
* `synonym`/`antonym` are imported with their base symbols unless declared `private`

```mizar
private pred helper(x, y) means ...;
private func intermediate(x) -> Real equals ...;
```

### Private symbols are excluded from import and apply to:

* Predicates, functors, modes, attributes, structures, theorems, etc.

Note: private declarations are also invisible to re-exporting modules
