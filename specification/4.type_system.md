## 4.1. Introduction to Mizar's Type System

### 4.1.1. Overview of Mizar's Type System

Mizar's type system is a sophisticated feature that forms the backbone of its formal mathematical language. Unlike many other proof assistants, Mizar's types are not part of the logical foundation of the system. Instead, Mizar is based on untyped set theory, and its type system can be understood as a layer of "soft typing" built on top of this foundation.

Key characteristics of Mizar's type system include:

1. **Soft Types**: Mizar's types are essentially syntactic constructs. They guide the writing and checking of mathematical statements but do not intrude into the underlying logical foundation of the system.

2. **Set-Theoretic Foundation**: All Mizar expressions are ultimately about sets. The types in Mizar can be thought of as predicates that classify these sets.

3. **Type Checking as Proof Obligation Generation**: When Mizar performs type checking, it generates proof obligations in first-order logic. These obligations, if proven, ensure the type correctness of the mathematical statements.

### 4.1.2. Key Concepts

Several key concepts form the foundation of Mizar's type system:

1. **Radix Types**: These are the basic types in Mizar, such as `set` (the root type) or user-defined types like modes and structures.

2. **Attributes**: These are type modifiers that can be applied to radix types. For example, `positive` and `negative` could be attributes applied to the `integer` type.

3. **Modes**: These are type constructors that define new types based on existing ones. They allow for more abstract type definitions and can be dependent.

4. **Structures**: These are composite types that group related data and properties, similar to record types in other systems.

5. **Clusters**: These are mechanisms for declaring relationships between types and attributes, such as subset relationships or attribute implications.

### 4.1.3. Relation to First-Order Logic

The relationship between Mizar's type system and first-order logic is central to its design:

1. **Types as Predicates**: Each type in Mizar corresponds to a predicate in first-order logic. For example, a type `T` is equivalent to a predicate `is_T(x)` in the underlying logic.

2. **Subtyping as Implication**: When one type is a subtype of another in Mizar, this relationship is represented as an implication in first-order logic. For instance, if `S` is a subtype of `T`, this is equivalent to the formula `∀x(is_S(x) ⇒ is_T(x))`.

3. **Type Erasure**: All type information in Mizar can be erased, resulting in untyped first-order logic formulas. This erasure process demonstrates that types in Mizar are not foundational to its logical system.

### 4.1.4. Design Philosophy

The design of Mizar's type system is guided by several key principles:

1. **Mathematical Intuitiveness**: The type system aims to closely align with mathematical thinking, allowing mathematicians to express concepts in a familiar way.

2. **Formal Rigor**: While intuitive, the system maintains strict formal semantics, ensuring that all expressions are unambiguous and logically sound.

3. **Expressiveness**: The type system is designed to handle a wide range of mathematical structures, from simple number systems to complex algebraic structures.

4. **Efficiency**: The type system is designed to allow for efficient type checking and inference, balancing expressiveness with practical implementation concerns.

5. **Set-Theoretic Foundation**: The type system is built on top of set theory, which allows for a clear separation between the type system and the underlying logical foundation.

By adhering to these principles, Mizar's type system provides a powerful tool for formalizing mathematics, striking a balance between intuitive expression and formal precision, while maintaining a clear connection to classical first-order logic and set theory.

## 4.2. Basic Types and Type Declarations

### 4.2.1. Built-in Types

Mizar's type system is built upon a foundation of basic types. In recent versions of the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML), the basic type hierarchy now includes:

1. **object**: The root type, representing all objects in the Mizar universe.
2. **set**: A subtype of `object`, representing mathematical sets.

The introduction of `object` as the root type allows for a distinction between primitive sets and other objects in the Mizar universe. `object` includes structural types defined by using `struct` keyword.

### 4.2.2. Syntax for Type Declarations

In Mizar, type declarations are made using specific keywords and constructs. Here are the main ways to declare and use types:

1. **Structure Definitions**

    Structures are used to define complex types with multiple fields:

    ```mizar
    definition
      struct Point2d where
        field x -> Real;
        field y -> Real;
      end
    end
    ```

2. **Attribute Definitions**

    Attributes are used to refine types:

    ```mizar
    definition
      let i be Integer;
      attr i is even means
      2 divides i;
    end;
    ```

3. **Mode Definitions**

    Modes are used to introduce new types:

    ```mizar
    definition
      mode Integer is integer Number;
    end;
    ```

    Modes and structures are collectively referred to as radix-types. These form the foundation for defining new types in the system.

4. **Type Expressions**

   Types can be combined and refined using various constructs:

   - Attribute application: `A T` (e.g., `positive Integer`)
   - Dependent types: `M of T` (where `M` is a mode that depends on `T`)

5. **Variable Declarations**

   Variables are declared with their types:

   ```mizar
   let n be positive Integer;
   let I be set;
   let f be Group-Family of I;
   ```

## 4.3. Structures

### 4.3.1. Concept and Purpose of Structures

Structures in Mizar are fundamental constructs used to define complex types that group related fields and properties. They serve several key purposes:

1. **Data Encapsulation**: Structures allow related pieces of data to be grouped together, similar to record types in other programming languages.
2. **Type Definition**: They form the basis for defining new types in the Mizar system, along with modes.
3. **Mathematical Modeling**: Structures provide a way to formally represent mathematical concepts that have multiple components or properties.

Structures are considered radix-types, meaning they form the foundation for defining new types in the system.

### 4.3.2. Syntax for Defining Structures

The syntax for defining structures in Mizar has been updated to provide more flexibility. The new syntax is as follows:

```mizar
definition
  struct StructureName where
    field field1 -> Type1;
    field field2 -> Type2;
    ...
    property property1 -> Type1';
    property property2 -> Type2';
    ...
  end
end
```

Key components of this syntax:

- `struct` keyword introduces a structure definition
- `StructureName` is the name of the new structure
- `field` declarations define the data components of the structure
- `property` declarations define properties associated with the structure

The distinction between `field` and `property` lies in their roles: fields represent intrinsic data, while properties represent derived data. For instance, in a group structure, the carrier set and binary operation are fields, while the identity element is a property as it is derived from the properties of the carrier and operation. Typically, property values are computed using functors that take field values as arguments.

Example:

```mizar
definition
  ::=
  `UnitalMagma` is a magma with an identity element.
  `UnitalMagma` consists of a set `carrier` with a single binary operator `binop`.
  Additionally, `UnitalMagma` has an identity element `unit` that is derived from
  the properties of `carrier` and `binop`.
  =::
  struct UnitalMagma where
    field carrier -> set;
    field binop -> BinOp of the carrier;
    property unit -> Element of carrier;
  end
end;
```

### 4.3.3. Inheritance Mechanisms

Mizar supports inheritance for structures, allowing a structure to inherit from existing ones. The syntax for inheritance is:

```mizar
definition
  inherit DerivedStructure from BaseStructure where
    field derivedField1 from baseField1;
    field derivedField2 from baseField2;
    ...
    property derivedProperty1 from baseProperty1;
    property derivedProperty2 from baseProperty2;
    ...
  end
end
```

Inheritance enables the reuse of predicates, functors, and attributes from the base structure through implicit type conversion (in the up-cast direction). A derived structure must inherit all fields and properties from its base structure; omitting any field or property will result in a compilation error. Furthermore, fields must be inherited as fields, and properties must be inherited as properties.

The new syntax separates structure declaration from inheritance declaration, allowing base structures to be added after the initial structure declaration. This separation, combined with field and property renaming, enables more flexible inheritance patterns.

Structures can also inherit from set types:

```mizar
inherit 1-sorted from set where
  field carrier from it;
end
```

Here, `it` refers to the set itself. This inheritance allows all predicates, functors, and attributes applicable to the set to be implicitly applied to the 1-sorted structure.

Inheritance supports type specialization of fields and properties:

```mizar
definition
  inherit T from S where
    ...
  end

  struct A where
    field a -> S;
  end

  struct B where
    field b -> T;
  end

  inherit B from A where
    field b inherit a;
    consistency;
  end
end
```

Type consistency must be proven, requiring a proof that `for a being S holds a is T`.

### 4.3.4. Multiple Inheritance and Diamond Inheritance

Mizar supports multiple inheritance, allowing structures to inherit from multiple base structures:

```mizar
definition
  inherit DerivedStructure from BaseStructure1 where
    ...
  end

  inherit DerivedStructure from BaseStructure2 where
    ...
  end
end
```

To prevent ambiguity, inheriting from the same named structure multiple times is prohibited. When multiple inheritance from the same structure is required, the structure must first be inherited and renamed. Diamond inheritance occurs when a structure inherits from two structures sharing a common ancestor:

```mizar
definition
  struct UnitStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property unit -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  struct ZeroStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property zero -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  inherit ZeroStr from UnitStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property zero from unit;
  end

  struct OneStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property one -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  inherit OneStr from UnitStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property one from unit;
  end

  struct ZeroOneStr where
    field carrier -> set;
    property zero -> Element of the carrier;
    property one -> Element of the carrier;
  end

  inherit ZeroOneStr from ZeroStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property zero from zero;
  end

  inherit ZeroOneStr from OneStr where
    field carrier from carrier;
    property one from one;
  end
end
```

In this example, `UnitStr` is renamed through inheritance to `ZeroStr` and `OneStr`, which are then inherited by `ZeroOneStr`. The common field `carrier` from `UnitStr` is merged in `ZeroOneStr`. Users must ensure the consistency of fields and properties in diamond inheritance scenarios.

### 4.3.5. Constructor

Structures can be instantiated using constructors, which provide mechanisms for object creation and type conversion. Mizar provides both default and custom constructors.

#### Default Constructors

Each structure definition implicitly creates a default constructor that supports two forms of argument passing:

1. **Positional Arguments**:
   Arguments are passed in the order of field and property declarations:

   ```mizar
   let A be set;
   let b be Element of A;
   set x = OneStr(A,b);  :: carrier=A, one=b
   ```

2. **Keyword Arguments**:
   Arguments can be passed in any order by explicitly naming the fields and properties:

   ```mizar
   set y = OneStr(one=b, carrier=A);
   ```

#### Custom Constructors

Constructors can be explicitly declared using the `constructor` keyword:

```mizar
definition
  let G be Group;
  constructor OneStr(G) where
    it.carrier = G.carrier;
    it.one = G.unit;
  end;
end;
```

The special identifier `it` refers to the structure being constructed, allowing field and property initialization.

#### Converting Constructors

A constructor that takes a single argument serves as a converting constructor, enabling implicit type conversion:

```mizar
let G be Group;
reconsider x = G as OneStr;  :: Implicit conversion from Group to OneStr
```

Converting constructors are particularly useful when working with inheritance hierarchies, allowing automatic conversion from base structures to their derived structures.
