# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Motivation for Mizar Redesign

The redesign of Mizar is driven by several key factors in the evolving landscape of formalization of mathematics and interactive theorem proving:

1. Modernization of Software Practices:
   Mizar, with its 50-year heritage, has been constrained by outdated software practices. This redesign introduces modern software paradigms such as templates, namespaces, module system and overload resolution enhancing efficiency and expressiveness in formalized proof development.

2. Revitalizing First-Order Logic Based Systems:
   While the trend in theorem proving has shifted towards higher-order logic and type theory, we believe there is significant value in advancing first-order logic based systems. This is supported by:
   a) Recent major advancements in automated theorem proving within first-order logic.
   b) The prevalence of set theory based on first-order logic as the common logical framework among mathematicians.
   c) The need for a system that bridges the gap between traditional mathematical thinking and formal verification.

3. Expanding Capabilities:
   By introducing features like tactics and algorithm verification, we aim to broaden Mizar's applicability beyond pure mathematics into areas such as software verification and formalized computer science.

4. Synergy with Large Language Models:
   With the acceleration of research in automated theorem proving using large language models, we recognize the potential for a more efficient approach. By integrating powerful automated theorem provers like [Vampire](https://vprover.github.io/) and [E](https://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html) as inference engines, Mizar aims to offer a system that is not only more effective but also more aligned with human mathematical reasoning.

5. Preserving Mathematical Intuition:
   Mizar stands out as the only interactive theorem prover with a language designed by a mathematician for mathematicians. This unique approach has garnered support from the formalization community for five decades, demonstrating its alignment with intuitive mathematical thinking and expression.

This redesign of Mizar is not just an update of an existing tool, but a strategic move to position first-order logic based theorem proving at the forefront of formal mathematics and automated reasoning. It aims to combine the strengths of traditional mathematical logic with modern software engineering practices and cutting-edge automated reasoning techniques, while maintaining its core philosophy of being a system that truly speaks the language of mathematicians.
