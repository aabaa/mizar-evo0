## 1.1 Background for Redesigning Mizar

The redesign of Mizar is driven by several key factors in the evolving landscape of formalization of mathematics and interactive theorem proving (ITP):

1. **Modernization of Software Practices**:  
    Mizar, with its 50-year heritage, has been constrained by outdated software practices. This redesign introduces modern software paradigms such as templates, namespaces, module system and overload resolution enhancing efficiency and expressiveness in formalized proof development.

2. **Revitalizing First-Order Logic Based Systems**:  
    While the trend in theorem proving has shifted towards higher-order logic and type theory, we believe there is significant value in advancing first-order logic based systems. This is supported by:  
   a) Recent major advancements in automated theorem proving (ATP) within first-order logic.
   b) The prevalence of set theory based on first-order logic as the common logical framework among mathematicians.  
   c) The need for a system that bridges the gap between traditional mathematical thinking and formal verification.  

3. **Expanding Capabilities**:  
    By introducing features like tactics and algorithm verification, we aim to broaden Mizar's applicability beyond pure mathematics into areas such as software verification and formalized computer science.

4. **Synergy with Large Language Models**:  
    With the acceleration of research in ATP using large language models, we recognize the potential for a more efficient approach. By integrating powerful ATPs like [Vampire](https://vprover.github.io/) and [E](https://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html) as inference engines, Mizar aims to offer a system that is not only more effective but also more aligned with human mathematical reasoning.

5. **Preserving Mathematical Intuition**:  
    Mizar stands out as the only ITP with a language designed by a mathematician for mathematicians. This unique approach has garnered support from the formalization community for five decades, demonstrating its alignment with intuitive mathematical thinking and expression.

6. **Disciplined Expressivity Over Syntactic Flexibility**:
    While some modern systems favor extensible syntax and meta-programming capabilities, Mizar adopts a more disciplined approach. By enforcing a stable and uniform syntax, the system promotes human readability, long-term maintainability, and alignment with traditional mathematical exposition. This design choice is intended to minimize cognitive overhead, allowing users to focus more fully on the essence of mathematical reasoning.

This redesign of Mizar is not just an update of an existing tool, but a strategic move to position first-order logic based theorem proving at the forefront of formal mathematics and automated reasoning. It aims to combine the strengths of traditional mathematical logic with modern software engineering practices and cutting-edge automated reasoning techniques, while maintaining its core philosophy of being a system that truly speaks the language of mathematicians.

## 1.3 Brief History of Mizar

Mizar, one of the oldest ITPs, has a rich history dating back to the early 1970s. Its development and evolution have been marked by significant milestones and achievements. Key events include:

- 1973: The Mizar project started under the leadership of Andrzej Trybulec.
- 1975: First version of Mizar-PC.
- 1982: First version of Mizar-MSE.
- 1989: Launch of [the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML)](https://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/library/), a comprehensive repository of formalized mathematics. Also, Launch of [Journal of Formalized Mathematics](https://fm.mizar.org/), pioneering machine-verified mathematical publications.
- 2001: Formalization of the Jordan Curve Theorem [^ART2005] [^ART2007].
- 1995-2003: Formalization of "Compendium of Continuous Lattice" [^BAN2002].

On September 2024, the Mizar project has completed formalizing 69 theorems on Freek Wiedijk's "[Formalizing 100 Theorems](https://www.cs.ru.nl/F.Wiedijk/100/)" list. For more detailed history and formalization achievement, please refer to Roman & Piotr (2005)[^ROM2005], Bancerek et al. (2015)[^BAN2015] and Bancerek et al. (2018)[^BAN2018].

The logical structure of the Mizar language is based on a variant of the classical first-order logic natural deduction system proposed by Jaśkowski. The Tarski-Grothendieck set theory, which is extension of ZFC set theory with strongly inaccessible cardinals, is applied as the foundation basis in the MML. The detailed  specifications of the current Mizar system, please refer to Grabowski et al.(2010) [^GRA2010]

Throughout its evolution, Mizar has maintained its core philosophy of closely mirroring natural mathematical language and reasoning. This approach has made it a favorite among the MML developers for formalizing complex mathematical proofs and theories. The system's longevity and consistent development have resulted in one of the largest libraries of formalized mathematics, covering a wide range of fields from basic set theory to advanced algebraic structures.

Mizar's influence extends beyond its direct applications, having inspired aspects of other proof assistants and contributing significantly to the field of formalized mathematics. The formalization of the Jordan Curve Theorem and the extensive work on Lattice Theory demonstrate Mizar's capability to handle complex mathematical concepts. Moreover, the contributions to Wiedijk's "100 Theorems" project highlight Mizar's role in the broader landscape of theorem provers.

As we embark on this redesign, we build upon this rich legacy, aiming to preserve Mizar's strengths while adapting to the changing landscape of formal verification and automated reasoning.
