### 1.1 Background

The redesign of the Mizar language addresses several modern needs in formal mathematics and interactive theorem proving:

* **Modern Software Practices**: The legacy system is modernized with templates, modules, namespaces, and overload resolution.
* **First-Order Logic Focus**: While higher-order logic has gained traction, first-order logic remains crucial for ATP integration and mathematical familiarity.
* **Enhanced Scope**: New features such as tactics and algorithm verification extend Mizar's application beyond mathematics into computer science.
* **AI Integration**: Integration with large language model-based ATPs (e.g., Vampire, E) improves automation and human-aligned reasoning.
* **Mathematical Readability**: Mizar continues its tradition of prioritizing mathematical intuition and natural language alignment.
* **Syntactic Discipline**: By enforcing uniform syntax, Mizar aims for high readability and long-term maintainability.

This redesign positions Mizar as a modern first-order logic-based system with strong integration capabilities and an intuitive language.

### 1.2 Purpose

This document defines the redesigned Mizar language. It aims to:

* Serve as an authoritative specification for syntax and semantics
* Guide users in writing formal mathematical texts
* Support tool and library developers
* Facilitate interoperability with external systems

The intended audience includes mathematicians, computer scientists, educators, software developers, and researchers in formal methods and automated reasoning.

### 1.3 Historical Note

Mizar, initiated in the 1973 by Andrzej Trybulec, has played a significant role in formal mathematics:

* 1989: Launch of the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML)
* 2001: Formalization of the Jordan Curve Theorem
* 2024: Completion of 69 theorems from Wiedijk's "Formalizing 100 Theorems"

The system is based on Ja≈õkowski-style natural deduction and Tarski-Grothendieck set theory. It has influenced other proof assistants and maintains one of the most extensive formalized libraries.

### 1.4 Feature Summary

Key features of the redesigned Mizar include:

* Robust module system and namespaces
* Generic programming via templates
* Improved type system with inference and overloading
* Tactic language and external prover integration
* Formal algorithm verification
* Enhanced error diagnostics and annotations
* Updated standard library
* Compatibility layer for legacy Mizar code

These improvements enhance Mizar's usability, expressiveness, and automation while preserving its mathematical orientation.
