## 15.1 Overview

A formula is a syntactic representation of a logical proposition. Unlike term expressions, which denote mathematical objects, formulas denote boolean-valued statements and are used within theorems, proofs, and control structures. Formula expressions are defined recursively and support logical composition, quantification, and special syntactic forms.

## 15.2 Syntax Summary

The syntax of formula expressions is defined by the following Lark grammar:

```lark
?formula: "(" formula ")"
        | atomic
        | quantified
        | formula "&" formula               -> and
        | formula "&" "..." "&" formula     -> and_multi
        | formula "or" formula              -> or
        | formula "or" "..." "or" formula   -> or_multi
        | formula "implies" formula         -> implies
        | formula "iff" formula             -> iff
        | "not" formula                     -> not
        | "contradiction"                   -> contradiction
        | "thesis"                          -> thesis

?atomic: predicate_application
       | inline_predicate_application
       | type_assertion
       | attribute_assertion

predicate_application: term_expr_list? negation? predicate term_expr_list?
inline_predicate_application: inline_predicate "(" term_expr_list? ")"
type_assertion: term_expr "is" type
attribute_assertion: term_expr "is" adjective+

negation: "does" "not" | "do" "not"
term_expr_list: term_expr ("," term_expr)*

quantified: "for" qualified_vars ["st" formula] ("holds" formula | quantified)
          | "ex" qualified_vars "st" formula

qualified_vars: implicit_vars
              | explicit_vars
              | explicit_vars "," implicit_vars

implicit_vars: var_list
explicit_vars: qualified_segment ("," qualified_segment)*
qualified_segment: var_list qualification
var_list: var ("," var)*
qualification: ("being" | "be") type
```

## 15.3 Atomic Formula Expressions

The atomic portion of the formula grammar, as defined in Lark, is reproduced here for clarity:

```lark
?atomic: predicate_application
       | inline_predicate_application
       | type_assertion
       | attribute_assertion

predicate_application: term_expr_list? negation? predicate term_expr_list?
inline_predicate_application: inline_predicate "(" term_expr_list? ")"
type_assertion: term_expr "is" type
attribute_assertion: term_expr "is" adjective+

negation: "does" "not" | "do" "not"
term_expr_list: term_expr ("," term_expr)*
```

### Predicate applications

A predicate may be applied to one or more arguments. The `does not` or `do not` modifier negates the predicate. For example:

```mizar
x does not divide y;
x, y do not commute;
```

### Type and property assertions

Type assertions use the `is` keyword:

```mizar
x is Nat;
y is positive even Integer;
```

Multiple adjectives can follow `is`, forming an attribute chain. These are interpreted conjunctively.

### Special constants

* `thesis` is a formula that means tautology and typically denotes the current goal in a proof block.
* `contradiction` is a formula that is always false and typically appears in proofs by contradiction

## 15.4 Special Formula Forms

The following are also recognized as special forms:

* Attribute tests with qualified types:

  ```mizar
  G is Group.associative;
  (G qua Magma) is associative;
  ```

* Negated type assertions:

  ```mizar
  x is not finite;
  ```

  This is equivalent to `not (x is finite)`.

## 15.5 Examples and Usage Patterns

```mizar
x is Nat;
x is non negative even Integer;
x, y are_congruent_mod N;
a does not divide b;
x is not finite;
thesis;
contradiction;
```

These forms serve as the building blocks of larger formulas, which can be composed using logical connectives and quantifiers as described in the next chapter.
