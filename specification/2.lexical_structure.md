## 2.1. Characters and Encoding

The Mizar system adopts Unicode UTF-8 encoding, allowing for diverse language representation in comments and specific annotations.

### 2.1.1. Character Usage

- **Code sections:** ASCII characters only (alphanumeric characters and basic symbols)
- **Comments and annotations:** Full Unicode character set (including extended Latin characters, Greek letters, mathematical symbols, etc.)
- **Control characters:** Only line breaks (LF, CR, or CRLF) and tabs are allowed

Direct input of mathematical symbols is restricted to comments and specific annotations. The Mizar processing system assumes an environment capable of correctly displaying both ASCII and Unicode characters.

### 2.1.2. Input and Display

- **Code input:** Standard ASCII input only
- **Comments and annotations input:**
    - Supports standard Unicode input methods
    - LaTeX-style input is possible (e.g., \alpha for Î±)
- **Character escaping:** Backslash (\\) is used for escaping special characters within string literals

### 2.1.3. Deprecated Usage

- Non-ASCII characters in code sections
- Control characters (U+0000 - U+001F, U+007F) except for line breaks and tabs
- Characters from the Private Use Area

By limiting code to ASCII characters, Mizar enhances searchability, while Unicode UTF-8 encoding maintains future extensibility.

## 2.2. Lexicon and Vocabularies

Mizar's lexical structure is defined by its lexicon, which consists of tokens recognized by the Mizar lexical processor. This lexicon comprises a basic lexicon and additional lexicons imported from constructors.

### 2.2.1. Lexicon Components

- **Basic Lexicon:** Includes reserved words (keywords), special symbols, numerals, and identifiers.

- **Additional Lexicons:** Defined in constructors, introducing symbols for various mathematical concepts and structures. These symbols are categorized into:
    - Mode symbols
    - Function symbols
    - Left or right function brackets
    - Structure symbols
    - Selector symbols
    - Attribute symbols
    - Predicate symbols

The complete lexicon of a Mizar article is the union of its basic lexicon and all imported additional lexicons via `import` statements.

### 2.2.2. Lexicon Characteristics

1. **Symbol Precedence:** Identifiers take precedence over Symbols defined in additional lexicons if they form a valid identifier.

2. **Article-Specific Scope:** Each article can use a different set of symbols by adjusting the import modules.

3. **Consistency:** The Mizar system ensures lexical consistency across imported symbols, detecting and reporting conflicts during processing.

## 2.3. Reserved Words

Reserved words (keywords) are predefined identifiers with special meanings in the Mizar language. These case-sensitive words cannot be used as identifiers for other purposes in Mizar code.

### 2.3.1. List of Reserved Words

```mizar
according aggregate all and antonym are as associativity
assume asymmetry attr
be begin being by
canceled case cases cluster coherence commutativity
compatibility conjecture connectedness consider consistency
constructors contradiction correctness
def deffunc define definition definitions defpred do does
end environ equals ex exactly existence export extend

registrations requirements reserve
sch scheme schemes section selector set sethood st struct
such suppose symmetry synonym
take that the then theorem theorems thesis thus to
transitivity
uniqueness
vocabularies
when where with wrt
```

### 2.3.2. Usage and Best Practices

1. **Synonyms**:
    - `be` and `being` are interchangeable
    - `hereby` is a shortcut for `thus now`

2. **Context-Specific Keywords**: Some words have special meanings in specific contexts but may be used as regular identifiers elsewhere:
    - `it` (often used in definitions)
    - `thesis` (used in proof steps)

3. **Best Practices**:
    - Avoid using identifiers similar to reserved words to prevent confusion
    - Be aware of the specific meanings and usages of reserved words in different Mizar contexts

4. **Future Considerations**: As Mizar evolves, new reserved words may be introduced. Users should consult the latest documentation for updates.

## 2.4. Special Symbols

Special symbols in Mizar are non-alphanumeric characters or character combinations that have specific meanings within the language. These symbols are essential for constructing various syntactic structures in Mizar.

### 2.4.1. List of Special Symbols

The following is the complete list of special symbols in Mizar:

```mizar
,   .   ;   :   (   )   [   ]   {   }   =   &   ->
.=   ...   $1   $2   $3   $4   $5   $6   $7   $8   $9   $10   (#   #)
```

### 2.4.2. Usage and Meanings

- `,` (comma): Used for separating items in lists or arguments.
- `.` (dot): Used to express relations of namespaces, modules, types and typed instances, and so on.
- `;` (semicolon): Typically used to end statements.
- `:` (colon): Used in various contexts, such as label declarations.
- `( )` (parentheses): Used for grouping expressions or arguments.
- `[ ]` (square brackets): Typically used to enclose arguments in a user-defined predicate. Also used in templates.
- `{ }` (curly braces): Typically used in Fraenkel operator and schema constructs.
- `=` (equals sign): Used for equality comparisons and definitions.
- `&` (ampersand): Typically used for logical AND operations.
- `->` (arrow): Typically used to denote return types.
- `.=` (dot-equals): Used in successive equality transformations.
- `...` (ellipsis): Used to denote omitted parts in certain contexts.
- `$1, $2, ..., $10`: Used for private definition parameters.
- `(# #)` (hash parentheses): Typically used to enclose fields in a structure definition.

## 2.5. Numerals and Literals

Mizar uses numerals to represent constant integer values directly in the code. Other types of literals are not built into the language but are typically defined in the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML).

### 2.5.1. Numerals and Integer Literals

Numerals are sequences of digits starting with a non-zero digit. Integer literals are represented by numerals and are inferred as `natural Number` type.

### 2.5.2. Other Types of Literals

- **Floating-Point**: Not built-in. Rational numbers are defined as mode in the MML.
- **String**: Not built-in.
- **Boolean**: Not explicit. Logical values are typically represented through predicates.
- **Special Constants**: Not built-in. Mathematical constants are typically defined as functors in the MML (e.g., PI, exp).

### 2.5.3. Best Practices and Future Considerations

1. Use numerals directly for small, specific integer values.
2. For larger numbers or repeated use, consider defining named constants.
3. Future versions of Mizar might introduce floating-point, string, and boolean literals.

## 2.6. Identifiers

Identifiers in Mizar name various entities such as variables, predicates, functors, and other user-defined constructs.

### 2.6.1. Syntax and Usage

An identifier is a case-sensitive sequence of ASCII letters, digits, underscores (_), and apostrophes (') that is not a reserved word.

```bnf
Identifier = (Letter | "_") { Letter | Digit | "_" | "'" } .
Letter = "A" | "B" | ... | "Z" | "a" | "b" | ... | "z" .
Digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" .
```

### 2.6.2. Scope and Precedence

- In the same scope, the last declared identifier takes precedence.
- In nested scopes, inner scope identifiers take precedence over outer scope ones.
- Identifiers can override symbols, allowing local redefinition or shadowing when necessary.

### 2.6.3. Best Practices and Warnings

1. Choose clear, meaningful, and consistently named identifiers.
2. Avoid overly long or cryptic names.
3. Consider using apostrophes for related concepts (e.g., `x` and `x'` for a value and its derivative).
4. Be cautious when overriding symbols to prevent confusion.
5. The lexical analyzer may issue warnings for duplicated identifiers or symbol overrides.

## 2.7. Symbols in Mizar

Symbols in Mizar represent mathematical concepts and are defined using specific keywords within articles. They have global scope and can be imported from other articles.

### 2.7.1. Definition and Usage

Symbols are defined using these keywords:

- `func`: functors
- `mode`: modes
- `attr`: attributes
- `pred`: predicates
- `struct`: structures (including selectors)
- `synonym`: synonyms
- `antonym`: antonyms

Once defined or imported, symbols can be used throughout the article.

### 2.7.2. Precedence and Restrictions

- Identifiers take precedence over conflicting symbols.
- Symbol names must not conflict with Mizar's reserved words or special symbols except `.`(dot).
- `.` (dot) can be defined as a symbol because of Mizar's historical background. Usually, `.` is used as functor symbols for function application. To avoid ambiguity in lexical analysis, the identifiers used around `.` should be given appropriate names.
- Mathematical notation, including special characters, can be used in appropriate contexts (e.g., comments or annotations).

## 2.8. File Names and Module Structure

Mizar organizes mathematical concepts into modules, each represented by a `.miz` file. The file and directory structure defines the module's namespace.

### 2.8.1. File and Module Basics

- File names: No longer restricted to 8 characters; should be descriptive
- File extension: `.miz`
- Namespace: Aligns with directory structure (e.g., `/mml/algebra/group.miz` defines `mml.algebra.group`)
- Content: Typically contains definitions, theorems, and proofs related to a specific mathematical concept

### 2.8.2. Import System

Mizar uses a Python-inspired import system, allowing access to elements from other modules. Various import syntax options are available (see [Chapter 3](./3.modules_and_namespaces.md) for details).

### 2.8.3. Best Practices

1. Use clear, descriptive file names
2. Use namespace structure to create a logical hierarchy
3. Document each module's purpose and contents in file header comments

For more information on modules, namespaces, and import directives, refer to [Chapter 3: Modules and Namespaces](./3.modules_and_namespaces.md).

## 2.9. Comments and Documentation

Mizar supports various types of comments for code annotation and documentation. Comments can include Unicode characters and LaTeX notation for mathematical expressions.

### 2.9.1. Types of Comments

1. **Single-line Comments**
    - Begin with `::`
    - Example: `:: This is a single-line comment`
    - Can be used inline: `let x be Real; :: Inline comment`

2. **Multi-line Comments**
    - Begin with `::=` and end with `=::`
    - Example:

        ```mizar
        ::=
        Multi-line comment
        Can include LaTeX: $E = mc^2$
        =::
        ```

    - Note: Avoid using `=::` within the comment

3. **Documentation Comments**
    - Begin with `:::`
    - Used for generating documentation
    - Place immediately before the described construct
    - Example:

        ```mizar
        ::: The Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
        theorem Pythagorean: ...
        ```

4. **Annotation Comments**
    - Begin with `@` followed by a keyword
    - Provide metadata or instructions to the Mizar system
    - Example: `::: @proof-sketch This proof proceeds by induction on $n$`

### 2.9.2. Special Features

- **Unicode Support**: All comments support full Unicode character set
- **LaTeX Notation**: Useful for complex mathematical expressions
    Example:

    ```mizar
    ::= $ \int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3} $ =::
    ```

## 2.10. Whitespace and Formatting

While whitespace is generally not significant in Mizar syntax, proper formatting improves code readability.

### 2.10.1. Key Concepts

1. **Whitespace Characters**
    - Space (U+0020), Tab (U+0009), Newline (LF: U+000A, CR: U+000D, or CRLF)
    - Multiple consecutive whitespace characters treated as a single space
    - Required to separate tokens where ambiguity might occur

2. **Indentation and Line Breaks**
    - Use 2 or 4 spaces for each indentation level
    - Use line breaks to separate logical parts of code
    - Use single blank lines to separate logical sections

3. **Formatting Guidelines**
    - Place one space after commas and semicolons
    - Place appropriate spaces between symbols to avoid unintended recognition.
    - Align related statements for visual clarity
    - Keep lines under 80-100 characters for readability

### 2.10.2. Example

```mizar
theorem Pythagorean:
  for a, b, c being Real st
  a > 0 & b > 0 & c > 0
  holds
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2 implies
  ex t being right Triangle st
    t.leg1 = a & t.leg2 = b & t.hypotenuse = c
proof
  let a, b, c be Real;
  assume A1: a > 0 & b > 0 & c > 0;
  assume A2: a^2 + b^2 = c^2;
  ...
end;
```

### 2.10.3. Best Practices

1. Maintain consistent formatting throughout your Mizar articles
2. Consider using an automated formatting tool if available
3. Break long lines at logical points, such as after operators or commas

Note: The previous limit of 80 characters per line has been removed.

## 2.11. Lexical Preprocessing

Lexical preprocessing in Mizar transforms raw input text into a sequence of tokens for further parsing. This process is context-sensitive due to symbol imports from other files.

### 2.11.1. Key Processes

1. **Character Set Handling**
    - UTF-8 encoding expected
    - Non-ASCII characters only in comments and specific annotations

2. **Whitespace and Comment Handling**
    - Consecutive whitespace condensed; leading/trailing whitespace trimmed
    - Comments removed (except documentation comments)

3. **Import Processing and Tokenization**
    - Import statements processed before full tokenization
    - Tokens (keywords, special symbols, symbols, identifiers, numerals) identified and classified

4. **Recognition and Processing**
    - Keywords, special symbols (except `.`) and numerals identified
    - Identifiers, `.` and symbols recognized based on context
    - Lexical errors detected

5. **Output and Conflict Handling**
    - Stream of classified tokens produced
    - Identifier-symbol overrides marked for later handling

### 2.11.2. Context Sensitivity

Mizar's lexical analyzer is context-sensitive due to the import mechanism. This allows flexible mathematical notation but requires careful handling.

### 2.11.3. Example

Consider three Mizar articles:

1. **Article A** (defines operators):

    ```mizar
    definition
      let x, y be Real;
      func x+*y -> Real means ...;
      func x*+y -> Real means ...;
      func x+ -> Real means ...;
    end;
    ```

2. **Article B** (imports and uses A's operators):

    ```mizar
    import A;
    let x, y be Real;
    x +* y;     :: Imported infix operator +*
    x *+ y;     :: Imported infix operator *+
    x +*+ y;    :: Interpreted as x +* (+ y)
    x + *+ y;   :: Interpreted as x + (*+ y)
    ```

3. **Article C** (imports and defines new operator):

    ```mizar
    import A;
    definition
      let x, y be Real;
      func x+*+y -> Real means ...;  :: New symbol +*+
    end;
    let x, y be Real;
    x +* y;   :: Imported infix operator +*
    x *+ y;   :: Imported infix operator *+
    x +*+ y;  :: New infix operator +*+
    ```

These examples demonstrate how context affects symbol interpretation in Mizar.
