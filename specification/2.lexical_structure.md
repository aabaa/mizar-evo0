# 2. Lexical Structure

## 2.1 Characters and Encoding

Mizar uses a clearly defined character set to accurately represent mathematical concepts while maintaining high readability and searchability of the code.

1. **Character Encoding**:
    - Mizar adopts Unicode UTF-8 encoding.
    - This allows for the representation of diverse languages and mathematical symbols within comments and specific annotations.

2. **Usable Characters**:
    - Code sections: ASCII characters only (alphanumeric characters and basic symbols)
    - Comments and specific annotations: Full Unicode character set (including extended Latin characters, Greek letters, mathematical symbols, etc.)

3. **Handling of Special Characters**:
    - Direct input of mathematical symbols is not allowed in code sections.
    - Direct use of mathematical symbols is only allowed within comments and specific annotations.

4. **Control Characters**:
    - Line breaks (LF: U+000A, CR: U+000D, or CRLF)
    - Tab (U+0009)
    - Use of other control characters is prohibited

5. **Character Display**:
    - The Mizar processing system assumes an environment capable of correctly displaying both ASCII and Unicode characters.
    - Appropriate fonts may be necessary for displaying Unicode characters in comments and annotations.

6. **Input Methods**:
    - Code sections: Standard ASCII input only
    - Comments and specific annotations:
        - Support for standard Unicode input methods
        - LaTeX-style input is also possible (e.g., \alpha for Î±)

7. **Character Escaping**:
    - Backslash (\\) is used for escaping special characters within string literals

8. **Deprecated Characters**:
    - Use of non-ASCII characters in code sections
    - Use of control characters (U+0000 - U+001F, U+007F) except for line breaks and tabs
    - Use of characters from the Private Use Area

This specification allows Mizar to maintain high searchability and readability of code while enabling rich mathematical expression through comments and specific annotations. By limiting code to ASCII characters, it ensures consistency and compatibility of the code, while the adoption of Unicode UTF-8 encoding maintains future extensibility.

## 2.2 Lexicon and Vocabularies

Mizar's lexical structure is defined by its lexicon, which consists of a set of tokens recognized by the Mizar lexical processor. This lexicon is composed of a basic lexicon and additional lexicons.

1. **Basic Lexicon**:  
The basic lexicon includes:
    - Reserved words (keywords)
    - Special symbols
    - Numerals
    - Identifiers

2. **Additional Lexicons**:
    - Additional lexicons are defined in constructors.
    - They introduce symbols for various mathematical concepts and structures.
    - Symbols are categorized into: mode symbols, function symbols, left or right function brackets, structure symbols, selector symbols, attribute symbols, and predicate symbols.

3. **Symbol Overriding**:
   - If an additional lexicon defines a symbol that forms a valid identifier, the symbol takes precedence over the identifier.

4. **Lexicon Composition**:
    - The complete lexicon of a Mizar article is the union of its basic lexicon and all imported additional lexicons by *import* declaration.

5. **Lexicon Scope**:
    - The lexicon is article-specific, allowing different articles to use different sets of symbols.

6. **Lexicon Consistency**:
    - The Mizar system ensures lexical consistency across imported symbols.
    - Conflicts between symbols are detected and reported during processing.

## 2.3 Reserved Words

Reserved words, also known as keywords, are predefined identifiers that have special meanings within the Mizar language. These words cannot be used as identifiers for other purposes in Mizar code.

1. List of Reserved Words:  
The following is the complete list of reserved words in Mizar:

    ```text
    according   aggregate   all   and
    antonym   are   as   associativity
    assume   asymmetry   attr   be
    begin   being   by   canceled
    case   cases   cluster   coherence
    commutativity   compatibility   connectedness   consider
    consistency   constructors   contradiction   correctness
    def   deffunc   define   definition
    definitions   defpred   do   does
    end   environ   equals   ex
    exactly   existence   for   from
    func   given   hence   hereby
    holds   idempotence   identify   if
    iff   implies   involutiveness   irreflexivity
    is   it   let   means
    mode   non   not   notation
    notations   now   of   or
    otherwise   over   per   pred
    prefix   projectivity   proof   provided
    qua   reconsider   reduce   reducibility
    redefine   reflexivity   registration   registrations
    requirements   reserve   sch   scheme
    schemes   section   selector   set
    sethood   st   struct   such
    suppose   symmetry   synonym   take
    that   the   then   theorem
    theorems   thesis   thus   to
    transitivity   uniqueness   vocabularies   when
    where   with   wrt
    ```

2. Usage Rules:
    - Reserved words are case-sensitive and must be written exactly as shown.
    - They cannot be used as identifiers for variables, predicates, functors or other user-defined entities.
    - Some reserved words may have context-specific meanings or usages within Mizar constructs.

3. Synonyms:
    - `be` and `being` are synonyms and can be used interchangeably.
    - `hereby` is a shortcut for `thus now`.

4. Context-Specific Keywords:  
Some words have special meanings in specific contexts, but may be used as regular identifiers elsewhere. These include:
    - `it` (often used in definitions)
    - `thesis` (used in proof steps)

5. Best Practices:
    - Avoid using identifiers that are similar to reserved words to prevent confusion.
    - Be aware of the specific meanings and usages of reserved words in different contexts within Mizar.

6. Future Considerations:
    - As Mizar evolves, new reserved words may be introduced. Users should consult the latest documentation for any updates to this list.

## 2.4 Special Symbols

Special symbols in Mizar are non-alphanumeric characters or character combinations that have specific meanings within the language. These symbols are essential for constructing various syntactic structures in Mizar.

1. List of Special Symbols:
    The following is the complete list of special symbols in Mizar:

    ```text
    ,   ;   :   (   )   [   ]   {   }   =   &   ->
    .=   ...   $1   $2   $3   $4   $5   $6   $7   $8   $9   $10   (#   #)
    ```

2. Usage and Meanings:
    - `,` (comma): Used for separating items in lists or arguments.
    - `;` (semicolon): Typically used to end statements.
    - `:` (colon): Used in various contexts, such as label declarations.
    - `( )` (parentheses): Used for grouping expressions or arguments.
    - `[ ]` (square brackets): Used to enclose arguments in a predicate or a bracket type functor.
    - `{ }` (curly braces): Typically used in Fraenkel operator and schema constructs.
    - `=` (equals sign): Used for equality comparisons and definitions.
    - `&` (ampersand): Typically used for logical AND operations.
    - `->` (arrow): Typically used to denote return types.
    - `.=` (dot-equals): Used in successive equality transformations.
    - `...` (ellipsis): Used to denote omitted parts in certain contexts.
    - `$1, $2, ..., $10`: Used for private definition parameters.
    - `(# #)` (hash parentheses): Typically used to enclose fields in a structure definition.

## 2.5 Numerals and Literals

Numerals and literals in Mizar are used to represent constant values directly in the code.

1. Numerals:
    - A numeral in Mizar is a sequence of digits starting with a non-zero digit:

        ```bnf
        Numeral = Non-Zero-Digit { 0 | Non-Zero-Digit } .
        Non-Zero-Digit = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 .
        ```

2. Integer Literals:
    - Integer literals are represented by numerals.
    - Mizar's type system will infer their types as `natural number`.

3. Floating-Point Literals:
    - Mizar does not have built-in floating-point literals. This restriction might be changed in the future version.
    - Rational numbers are defined as `mode` in the MML.

4. String Literals:
    - Mizar does not have built-in string literals. This restriction might be changed in the future version.

5. Boolean Literals:
    - Mizar does not have explicit boolean literals. This restriction might be changed in the future version.
    - Logical values are typically represented through predicates.

6. Special Constants:
    - Mizar does not have built-in special constants.
    - Mathematical constants are typically defined as functors in the MML (e.g., `PI`, `exp`).

7. Best Practices:
    - Use numerals directly for small, specific integer values.
    - For larger numbers or repeated use, consider defining named constants.
