## 2.1 Characters and Encoding

Mizar uses a clearly defined character set to accurately represent mathematical concepts while maintaining high readability and searchability of the code.

1. **Character Encoding**:
   - Mizar adopts Unicode UTF-8 encoding.
   - This allows for the representation of diverse languages and mathematical symbols within comments and specific annotations.

2. **Usable Characters**:
   - Code sections: ASCII characters only (alphanumeric characters and basic symbols)
   - Comments and specific annotations: Full Unicode character set (including extended Latin characters, Greek letters, mathematical symbols, etc.)

3. **Handling of Special Characters**:
   - Direct input of mathematical symbols is not allowed in code sections.
   - Direct use of mathematical symbols is only allowed within comments and specific annotations.

4. **Control Characters**:
   - Line breaks (LF: U+000A, CR: U+000D, or CRLF)
   - Tab (U+0009)
   - Use of other control characters is prohibited

5. **Character Display**:
   - The Mizar processing system assumes an environment capable of correctly displaying both ASCII and Unicode characters.
   - Appropriate fonts may be necessary for displaying Unicode characters in comments and annotations.

6. **Input Methods**:
   - Code sections: Standard ASCII input only
   - Comments and specific annotations:
     - Support for standard Unicode input methods
     - LaTeX-style input is also possible (e.g., \alpha for Î±)

7. **Character Escaping**:
   - Backslash (\\) is used for escaping special characters within string literals

8. **Deprecated Characters**:
   - Use of non-ASCII characters in code sections
   - Use of control characters (U+0000 - U+001F, U+007F) except for line breaks and tabs
   - Use of characters from the Private Use Area

This specification allows Mizar to maintain high searchability and readability of code while enabling rich mathematical expression through comments and specific annotations. By limiting code to ASCII characters, it ensures consistency and compatibility of the code, while the adoption of Unicode UTF-8 encoding maintains future extensibility.
