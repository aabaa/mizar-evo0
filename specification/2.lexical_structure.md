# 2. Lexical Structure

## 2.1 Characters and Encoding

Mizar uses a clearly defined character set to accurately represent mathematical concepts while maintaining high readability and searchability of the code.

1. **Character Encoding**:
   - Mizar adopts Unicode UTF-8 encoding.
   - This allows for the representation of diverse languages and mathematical symbols within comments and specific annotations.

2. **Usable Characters**:
   - Code sections: ASCII characters only (alphanumeric characters and basic symbols)
   - Comments and specific annotations: Full Unicode character set (including extended Latin characters, Greek letters, mathematical symbols, etc.)

3. **Handling of Special Characters**:
   - Direct input of mathematical symbols is not allowed in code sections.
   - Direct use of mathematical symbols is only allowed within comments and specific annotations.

4. **Control Characters**:
   - Line breaks (LF: U+000A, CR: U+000D, or CRLF)
   - Tab (U+0009)
   - Use of other control characters is prohibited

5. **Character Display**:
   - The Mizar processing system assumes an environment capable of correctly displaying both ASCII and Unicode characters.
   - Appropriate fonts may be necessary for displaying Unicode characters in comments and annotations.

6. **Input Methods**:
   - Code sections: Standard ASCII input only
   - Comments and specific annotations:
     - Support for standard Unicode input methods
     - LaTeX-style input is also possible (e.g., \alpha for Î±)

7. **Character Escaping**:
   - Backslash (\\) is used for escaping special characters within string literals

8. **Deprecated Characters**:
   - Use of non-ASCII characters in code sections
   - Use of control characters (U+0000 - U+001F, U+007F) except for line breaks and tabs
   - Use of characters from the Private Use Area

This specification allows Mizar to maintain high searchability and readability of code while enabling rich mathematical expression through comments and specific annotations. By limiting code to ASCII characters, it ensures consistency and compatibility of the code, while the adoption of Unicode UTF-8 encoding maintains future extensibility.

## 2.2 Lexicon and Vocabularies

Mizar's lexical structure is defined by its lexicon, which consists of a set of tokens recognized by the Mizar lexical processor. This lexicon is composed of a basic lexicon and additional lexicons.

1. **Basic Lexicon**:
   The basic lexicon includes:
   - Reserved words (keywords)
   - Special symbols
   - Numerals
   - Identifiers

2. **Additional Lexicons**:
   - Additional lexicons are defined in constructors.
   - They introduce symbols for various mathematical concepts and structures.
   - Symbols are categorized into: mode symbols, function symbols, left or right function brackets, structure symbols, selector symbols, attribute symbols, and predicate symbols.

3. **Symbol Overriding**:
   - If an additional lexicon defines a symbol that forms a valid identifier, the symbol takes precedence over the identifier.

4. **Lexicon Composition**:
   - The complete lexicon of a Mizar article is the union of its basic lexicon and all imported additional lexicons by *import* declaration.

5. **Lexicon Scope**:
   - The lexicon is article-specific, allowing different articles to use different sets of symbols.

6. **Lexicon Consistency**:
   - The Mizar system ensures lexical consistency across imported symbols.
   - Conflicts between symbols are detected and reported during processing.
