## 4.1 Variables in First-Order Logic and Mizar

Mizar extends first-order logic (FOL) by introducing typed variables.

* **FOL**: `x` is untyped; quantified over the domain
* **Mizar**: `let x be Real;` implies `Real(x)` in logical terms

## 4.2 Variable Declarations

### 4.2.1 Basic Syntax

```mizar
let x be Real;
let n be Nat;
let G be Group;
```

### 4.2.2 Constraints (Attributes)

```mizar
let n be positive Nat;
let S be non empty set;
let a be positive even Integer;
```

### 4.2.3 Multiple Declarations

```mizar
let x, y, z be Real;
let m, n be Nat;
```

## 4.3 Constants

### 4.3.1 Numerals

* Represent natural numbers: `0, 1, 2, ...`
* Inferred as `natural Number`

### 4.3.2 Set Declarations

```mizar
set X = {1, 2, 3};
set f = id REAL;
set n = 2 + 3;
```

You can redefine type using `reconsider`:

```mizar
reconsider X as finite set;
```

## 4.4 Variable Scoping Rules

Note: `reserve` is not a variable declaration. It is a directive that allows omitting the type specification in subsequent variable declarations within the module.

### 4.4.1 Local Scope

* `for x being T` introduces bound variables
* `let x be T;` in `proof` block declares local instantiation

### 4.4.2 Nested Scope and Shadowing

Inner variables can shadow outer ones:

```mizar
let x be Real;
proof
  let x be Nat;  :: valid shadowing
end
```

### 4.4.3 Reserved Type Declarations

The `reserve` statement declares that a given identifier will always refer to a value of a specified type within the current module. It does **not** bind the variable; it only provides a type default:

```mizar
reserve x for Real;
```

This allows type specification to be omitted later:

```mizar
let x;
```

This is equivalent to:

```mizar
let x be Real;
```

Local contexts can override the reserved type:

```mizar
for x being Nat holds ...
```

### 4.4.4 Quantified Variables

```mizar
for x being Real holds P(x);
ex n being Nat st Q(n);
```

### 4.4.5 Identifier Precedence

Identifiers declared as variables override imported symbols:

```mizar
import module_with_symbol_id;
reserve id for Real;  :: refers to variable, not symbol
let id be Nat;  :: it overrides the above variable type
```

### 4.4.6 Scoping Errors

* Redeclaring with incompatible type in same scope is error:

```mizar
let x be Real;
let x be Nat;  :: Error
```

* Shadowing in inner blocks is allowed

## 4.5 Summary

* Mizar variables are typed and follow lexical scoping
* `let`, `set`, and quantifiers each introduce variable bindings
* `reserve` is a type hint for later declarations, not a binding
* Scoping rules and identifier resolution are critical for correct parsing and proof checking
