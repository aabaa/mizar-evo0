### 5.1. Overview

Mizar Evolution adopts a soft typing system layered on untyped set theory. Types serve as syntactic guides and are not part of the logical foundation. All expressions ultimately denote sets, and type checking is implemented as generation of proof obligations in first-order logic. For an in-depth discussion of Mizar's soft typing, see:

### 5.2. Core Concepts

* **Radix-types**: Root types including built-in types (`object`, `set`) and user-defined types (`mode`, `struct`).
* **Attributes**: Unary predicates that refine existing types.
* **Modes**: Type constructors defining new types using attributes and existing radix-types.
* **Structures**: Composite radix-types grouping fields and properties.
* **Clusters**: Mechanisms that declare relationships among types and attributes.

### 5.3. Logical Interpretation

* A type `T` is interpreted as a predicate `is_T(x)`.
* Subtyping is modeled as implication: `is_S(x) â‡’ is_T(x)`.
* All typing can be erased to yield a pure first-order representation.

### 5.4. Design Principles

* **Mathematical alignment**: Types are designed to match mathematical practice.
* **Separation of concerns**: Types guide readability and verification but are erased for logical core.
* **Efficiency**: Syntax and inference mechanisms are optimized for fast checking.
* **Consistency**: All typing constructs follow unified syntax and semantics.

### 5.5. Built-in Types

* `object`: Universal type representing all elements in the Mizar universe, including structural types.
* `set`: Subtype of `object`. Represents mathematical sets in the traditional sense. Structural types (defined via `struct`) are included in `object` but not in `set`.

### 5.6. Type Declarations

#### Structures

Defined using `struct`:

```mizar
struct Point2d where
  field x -> Real;
  field y -> Real;
end
```

#### Attributes

Defined using `attr`:

```mizar
definition
  let i be Integer;
  attr i is even means 2 divides i;
end
```

#### Modes

Defined using `mode`:

```mizar
definition
  mode Integer is integer Number;
end
```

Modes can include attribute chains and can be parameterized.

#### Variable Declarations

```mizar
let n be positive Integer;
let I be set;
let f be Group-Family of I;
```

#### Type Expressions

* Attribute application: `positive Integer`
* Dependent modes: `Group-Family of I`

Type expressions may involve inheritance and clustering.
