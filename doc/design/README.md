# Internal Design Specifications

This directory contains internal implementation specifications organized at two levels:

## 1. Architecture Specifications (`architecture/`)

Cross-cutting design documents that span multiple modules or crates.
These define **subsystem boundaries, protocols, and design decisions** that cannot be captured at the individual module level.

```
doc/design/architecture/<topic>.md
```

Typical topics include:
- Reasoning boundaries (what the kernel handles vs. what ATPs handle)
- Inter-subsystem communication protocols (TPTP, SMT-LIB)
- Integration strategies for external tools
- Proof certificate formats

See [`architecture/README.md`](./architecture/README.md) for details and the document template.

## 2. Module Specifications (`<crate-name>/`)

Detailed specifications that map **1:1** to Rust source files.

```
doc/design/<crate-name>/<module>.md  →  crates/<crate-name>/src/<module>.rs
```

### Module Specification Template

Each module spec should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Module: <module_name>

## Purpose
Brief description of what this module does.

## Public API
List of public functions, structs, traits, and their signatures.

## Dependencies
- Internal: which other modules this depends on
- External: crate dependencies

## Data Structures
Detailed description of key types.

## Algorithm / Logic
Step-by-step description of the core logic.

## Error Handling
Expected error conditions and how they are handled.

## Tests
Key test scenarios that must pass.
```

## Relationship Between Layers

```
doc/idea/                          Immature ideas, brainstorming
   ↓  (matured)
doc/design/architecture/           Confirmed cross-cutting design decisions
   ↓  (decomposed into modules)
doc/design/<crate>/<module>.md     Per-file implementation specifications
   ↓  (implemented)
crates/<crate>/src/<module>.rs     Rust source code
```

## Workflow

1. Start with an idea in `doc/idea/`
2. When a design decision is confirmed, promote it to `doc/design/architecture/`
3. Decompose into module-level specs in `doc/design/<crate>/`
4. Implement (or ask AI to implement) the corresponding Rust source
5. Run tests to verify the implementation matches the spec
6. Keep specs and code in sync — update both together
